'Now, you must shove each one up your arse without showing any emotion, or we'll eat you' say the cannibals.  The brunette gets halfway through shoving the second one up when she starts to cry from the pain. The cannibals kill and eat her, and she floats up to heaven.

The redhead is wise and picks ten blueberries, and arrives back before the blonde. She shoves nine blueberries up her arse with no emotion, but whilst looking into the forest from the window suddenly bursts into laughter before she gets to the tenth. This being a form of emotion, the cannibals kill and eat her, and she floats up to heaven.  Up in heaven, the brunette scolds the redhead. 'You were so close, what the hell happened?!'

The young woman’s legs were behind her head as her boyfriend went to town.  Caught in the act, the two stop, and the nurse begs the old woman not to tell. “Please! You know they’ll fire me!”  The old woman stops and thinks. She and her husband haven’t had sex in years. A new position like this could really help get things  going again, so she makes the nurse a deal. “I won’t tell, but you’ve got to train me how to do this, so I can try it with my husband.”  The nurse is skeptical, but desperate to keep her job, she agrees.  For months, the old woman and the nurse practice stretching. Finally after huge effort, the old woman manages to get one leg behind her head.  The two continue practicing. Month after month they work on it, stretching, training, slowly getting better. Finally, one day, the old woman manages to get both legs behind her head.  That night, finally ready to surprise her husband with her new ability, the old woman strips down and hops on her bed to get ready for when he returned to their room.  Slowly, slowly she puts one leg behind her head. Slowly, slowly she puts the other one up, too.   She hears her husband at the door, but in her excitement she slips and rolls on to her back.  Her husband enters the room and finds her in this position and says,  “Oh for godssakes, Margaret, put your teeth back in. You look like an asshole.”"}

After hearing the joke, one of his classmates reported him to the school staff for nothing other then the fact that they were butthurt and super disliked it.    Two others reported it to the staff because he was stole the joke from another student.  Of course, the staff ignored the report because the students were too damn lazy to read to school’s bulletin board.    Three brave students reported it as they thought the kid was a robot, obviously not true, and as such they were found and expelled from the school.  In the end, none of the reports did anything to the joke and it kept being told over and over again in the school.  It’s really too bad, telling stolen jokes for popularity."}

He'd risked his entire life savings to make the trek to the Yukon to prospect. He started his journey full of excitement and hope. he'd purchased his nearly 2,000lbs of gear and supplies and two fine stock horses to help him carry it.  The voyage to Skagway was difficult. The seas were rough and Jonathan spent many hours at the rail, emptying his stomach into the frigid, frothing waters.  His journey from Skagway to the Klondike wasn't any easier. Halfway through the journey, a blizzard caught him by surprise. One of his two pack horses didn't survive the frigid night. Wolves took care of the other three days later.   Pressing on he finally arrived in the Yukon, pulling his sled by hand. There, he discovered that all the claims had been taken, except for one on the outskirts of the town. The claim had not been taken because it seemed to have little promise.   He worked the claim for weeks, with his gold pan, his pick, and his shovel. Day after day he toiled, his supplies and hope dwindling with each shovel-full of frozen soil lifted from the earth.   After 9 months, his food supplies were exhausted, as were his mind and body. For all his labor, Jonathan still had nothing to show for all his labor. Dejected and despairing, he made his way back to Dawson and spent his last dollar on a shot of watered-down cheap whiskey. He'd brought his gold pan with him to use as a plate for a meal, but he didn't have the means to purchase even a cup of moose stew.   With tears welling in his eyes, he left the bar and slumped to the muddy boardwalk outside the blacksmith shop. The pan dropped from his dejected fingers onto the ground in front of him.   After all his labor, sacrifice, sweat, blood, and tears, he had nothing to show for it. Full of shame and despair, he wept in bitterness unabashedly, heedless of the men passing by on the boardwalk.   A few minutes later, a prospector in a fine broadcloth suit and a bear skin coat passed by young Jonathan. Looking down at Jonathan, he took pity on the broken young man. From his pocket he pulled forth a nugget the size of an acorn. Bending low, he dropped it into Jonathan's discarded pan with a loud clang.   Jonathan, aroused by this sound, shook himself free of his stupified state. He stared down into the pan, disbelief dawning on his tear stained face.   Looking up at the man, with gratitude in his eyes, he said in a breaking voice, \"Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!\""}

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.   Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.   Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.   \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.  The man looked at the executioner and said, \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\""}

So, that's what happened.  For the first couple of weeks the bluebird felt as free as....well, a bird, of course. Flying here-to-there, there-to-wherever his little bird eyes fancied. It wasn't long, though, until the first snowflakes began to pull down their cold aura onto the fields, trees, brooks, and hills....and, or course the little headstrong bluebird...  As the pocket-sized plumed pilot started to realize the gravity of his dilemma his wings froze in mid-flight.  He dropped like a stone from the sky.  *SPLatttt!  Right into the middle of a fresh, steaming, splattered heap of cow pucky.  Seconds later, the thawed tiny bird stuck his head out of the manure and began chirping and singing as happily and loudly as his little heart and lungs could muster.  It was at that moment a big ornery farm cat pounced over, scooped up the little bluebird, and promptly swallowed him whole.  Moral of the story: -Being in a shitty situation isn't always as  bad as it seems—look at the  bright side. -Not everyone who helps you out of a shitty situation is your friend. -And, lastly, if you're up to your ears in shit,. but you're happy, keep your mouth shut."}

And on that island there lived the native tribe, who called themselves, \"Trids\". Trids inhabited the island by themselves. They made their own cities and an organized government to prevent chaos. All was well for the Trids, life was good and peaceful. One day, one of the Trids decided he wanted to climb up a mountain to pick berries at the top. He climbed about halfway up, but then he was kicked off the mountain and into the ocean by a giant. Another Trid wanted to find out what was going on, so he climbed up the mountain. He got about halfway up and then the giant kicked him down. Finally, a third Trid climbed the mountain.  He begged, \"Please don't kick me down.\" The giant didn't care, the giant kicked him down anyways. Remember how I said the Trids were the *only* people on the island? I wasn't telling the full truth. On the island, they had a rabbi. The rabbi wasn't actually a Trid by blood, but the rabbi was still one of the highest-ranking officials in the Trid community. After Trids were getting kicked off the mountain, they decided to bring up this issue to the rabbi.  A Trid approched the rabbi and said, \"Rabbi! Rabbi! We want to climb the mountain but the giant keeps kicking us off.\" The rabbi then agreed he would climb the mountain and talk to the giant.  The next day rolls around and the rabbi begins climbing the mountain. He gets about halfway up, and surprisingly, the giant doesn't kick him down. He climbs a little higher, still no kick. He climbs all the way to the top of the mountain, the giant still doesn't kick him. The rabbi then looks the giant in the eyes and asks, \"Why is it that when one of the Trids climbs the mountain you kick them off, but when I climb the mountain, you don't.\"   The giant chuckles as he says, *\"Silly rabbi, kicks are for Trids.\"*"}

I was cleaning out my wife's grandpa's cellar and found 12 bottles of his home-bottled grape wine under the steps. My wife told me to empty the contents of each and every bottle down the sink, or else. I agreed to do the unpleasant task.  I withdrew the cork form the first bottle and poured the contents down the sink, with the exception of one glass, which I drank. I extracted the cork from the second bottle, did likewise, and drank one glass, just to check the taste to see if the old fellow knew his wine making. He did.   I then opened the third bottle, and poured it, too, down the sink, but not until drinking one full glass to check the purity. It was very good. I did this, also with the fourth bottle. One glass for myself, and the rest down the sink. I pulled the bottle from the cork of the next, and drank one sink out of it and threw the rest down the glass. I pulled the sink out of the next glass and poured the cork from the bottle, then corked the sink with the glass, bottled the drink and drank the pour.   When I had everything emptied, I steadied the house with one hand, counted the bottles, corks, glasses and sinks with the other, which were 29, and as the house came by I counted them again, and finally had all the houses in one bottle, which I drank. I felt so foolish that I couldn't go upstairs and congratulate my wife to tell her what a great winemaker her grandpa was. I will do that after climbing the basement steps the next time they come by."}

She shrugged and padded away.   Water kept rising, and the guy moved to his second, top floor. Soon, he heard a boat's engine, and he looked out the window.  \"Hey, you in the window! Get in!\" the captain shouted.  \"Nah, God will save me!\"  The captain stared, then shrugged and decided to go rescue other people.   It started getting dark and water kept rising, so Bob had to get on his roof. Suddenly, a bright light shone on him from the sky, he looked up and smiled, ready to be saved by the Lord.  Then, a piece of rope slapped him in the face and a megaphone boomed, \"Get on the rope ladder, we'll pull you in! Quickly!\"  Disappointed, Bob yelled back \"no need! Go away!\"  The pilot then pulled the ladder in, evacuating as the weather started to become too bad to fly.   Bob eventually drowned and faced God in Heaven.  \"Why didn't you save me?\" he asked, upset.  \"What do you mean, Bob? I've sent you a raft, a boat, and even a helicopter!\""}

Here's a joke I stole from an /r/AskReddit thread --------------  There was this guy walking down the road when he noticed a night club ahead. He went in, went up to the bar and asked for a drink. The bar owner, who was tending bar, said, \"I've never seen you in her before.\"  The guy says, \"Yes, I'm not from around here. I'm just passing through on my way to find a job.\"  The owner asks, \"What do you do?\"  The guy says, \"I write music and play the piano.\"  The owner, looking excited says, \"REALLY! I have an ad in the paper looking for someone to play my piano. Please sit down at the keyboard and play for me if you're interested.\"  The guy does and as he plays the piano the owner is in awe of his talent and musical abilities. The owner says, \"You play the piano more beautifully than anyone I have ever heard! What is the name of that song?\"  The guy says, \"I wrote that song and the name is Two Lesbians Fucking Their Brains Out.\"  The owner gasps and is taken back. He says, \"My gosh, that's a terrible name for such a beautiful song. Do you know any others?\"  The guy smiles and plays again. Once more the owner is astounded by this guy's talent and musical abilities. He's almost afraid to ask but he does ask what the name of the song he just played.  The guy answers, \"I Fucked Her All Night Until She Couldn't Take Anymore.\"  The owner again was shocked. The owner says, \"OK, you play beautifully and the songs you have written are incredible. I will hire you, but you have to promise not to tell the name of your songs to the patrons.\" The guy agrees.  That night the guy was playing the piano and the crowd was just as amazed as the owner was with this man's musical abilities. After playing two songs the crowd stood up and applauded. The guy was really pleased and stood up to take a bow. When he stood up and faced the audience, it was apparent that his zipper was open and his dick and balls were hanging out.  One of the patrons close to the piano says, \"Sir, do you know your dick and balls are hanging out?\"  The guy smiles and says, \"KNOW IT, I WROTE IT!\""}

He had toy tractors, tractor bedsheets, tractor memorabilia - anything to do with tractors fascinated him. For his 12th birthday, his mother decided to take him to a tractor convention and Sam wanted me along for the ride. We drove four hours to get there, and upon our arrival Sam was smitten by a new model on display. He approached the owner and asked politely if he could access the tractor and look around inside it.  The owner refused. Sam asked again, to no avail.  Heartbroken, Sam demanded we leave. The long four hour drive back was in silence. As we entered his bedroom back home, he began tearing down all his posters, binned his bedsheets, threw out his memorabilia. He never spoke of tractors again - except once, several years later.  We were walking together to a bar, when Sam noticed a house on fire, screams emanating from it. He quickly ran at the house, and simply sucked all the fire and smoke out, saving the inhabitants. I was shocked, and when I replied with how he could have performed such an action, he shrugged and said:  'I'm an ex-tractor fan'."}

Of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.  The husband cringed, 'I warned you to be careful! Now we'll have to go up there, find the owner, apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us.'  So the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. A warm voice said, 'Come on in.'  When they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.  A man reclining on the couch asked, 'Are you the people that broke my window?'  'Uh...yeah! , sir. We're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.  'Oh, no apology is necessary. Actually I want to thank you.. You see, I'm a genie, and I've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. Now that you've released me, I'm allowed to grant three wishes. I'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, I'll keep the last one for my self.'  Wow, that's great!' the husband said. He pondered a moment and blurted out, 'I'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'  'No problem,' said the genie 'You've got it, it's the least I can do.. And I'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'  'And now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.  'I'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.  'Consider it done,' the genie said. 'And your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'  'And now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'  'Well, since I've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'  The husband looked at his wife and said, 'Gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. What do you think?'  She mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'You know, you're right. Considering our good fortune, I guess I wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'  You know I love you sweetheart,' said the husband. I'd do the same for you!'  So the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.  The genie was insatiable. After about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, How old are you and your husband?'  'Why, we're both 35,' she responded breathlessly.  'No Kidding,' he said.  'Thirty-five years old and you both still believe in genies?'"}

Fed up with the hustle and the bustle. Fed up with the fickle market. But one night, sipping scotch, he realized that the root of all his problems was PEOPLE.    And being a man of action, Tom went into work the next day, quit his job, and headed out west to find solitude.  A place where no one would ever bother him.  He bought an abandoned cabin in the wilds of Montana with no people as far as the eye could see.  The first morning, he was outside working hard--repairing a fence, digging out his garden.  It was hard work, but it felt good.  Just then, in the distance, he saw a sight that made his heart sink: a rusty old pickup truck driving right toward him!  As it pulled up, a big old grizzly mountain man hopped out with a shout of \"Hi ho neighbor! I live on the other side of that there mountain, and I wanna welcome you to the neighborhood!  In fact, you've got great timing, because I'm throwing a neighborhood block party this Friday, and you would be MOST welcome!\"   Tom stopped him in his tracks: \"I'm sorry, sir, but I moved here to get AWAY from...\"    The mountain man interrupted: \"But before you say yes, I gotta warn ya...there's going to be some DRINKIN'.\"  Tom was quick to answer: \"Well sir, I assure you I can handle my alcohol, but I still have to say...\"  But the mountain man interrupted again: \"OH, and I gotta warn ya...there's gonna be some FIGHTIN'.\"  Tom once again answered dutifully: \"Well sir, I come from New York City, lived right off of 42nd Street and I've seen my share of rough behavior, and nothing really compares with having to stare down aggressive business folks trying to screw you out of every penny, but I still have to say n-...\"  One last time the mountain man interrupted: \"I understand that sir, you must be one tough fella, but before you say yes, I gotta warn ya... there's gonna be some SEX.\"  At this, Tom had had enough, and truthfully, his curiosity was piqued. \"Sir, I've seen things in New York City you've only dreamed of, I'm sure I can handle this backwoods block party. And I'd be happy to come to your party, I suppose it's the neighborly thing to do.\"  The mountain man was delighted. He hopped back in the pickup truck with a jump in his surprisingly spry legs, and started to drive off.  But Tom quickly flagged him down: \"Sir, one thing--I don't know much about this neighborhood--what should I wear, is it going to dress up, or casual, or...\"  The mountain man looked puzzled.  As he drove off, he shouted, \"Suit yourself! It's just gonna be you and me!\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "Dracula in Italy Count Dracula, fed up with the miserable weather in Transylvania, decides to take a holiday, so he packs up his coffin and capes and heads to Rome for a long weekend. Upon arriving at his hotel the concierge greets him and asks if has a reservation. \"Yessss,\" replies the Count.  \"I am Dracula, prince of darkness!\" The concierge consults his computer. \"Ah yes, here we are. Single room, non-smoking with balcony... We've put you in room 317.\"  He hands Dracula the key.  Pocketing it, the vampire - seized by a terrible, ravenous hunger - grabs the concierge by the collar, drags him over the desk, and sinks his fangs into the poor man's neck.  After draining every last drop of blood from his victim Dracula tosses the corpse away like a ragdoll.  Meanwhile... just outside the hotel, a tourist from London is strolling by, admiring the architecture.  As he stops to examine a particularly beautiful fountain, the bloodless corpse of the concierge comes flying out of the hotel and CLOBBERS him, knocking him to the ground.  Back the hotel lobby, Count Dracula is approached by a bellboy, who offers to take the Count's suitcases and coffin up to room 317. \"Right this way Mister, um...\" \"Dracula,\" the Count intones.  \"I am Count Dracula, Prince of Darkness, despoiler of virgins.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" the bellboy says with a cheerful grin.  \"I'm Fabrizio.\" After lugging the cases and the coffin up three flights of stairs a profusely sweating Fabrizio opens the door to Dracula's room, puts the luggage down, and turns to the Count with an expectant look. \"Will there be anything else, sir?\" The Count thinks about this for a moment.  Then his eyes turn a hideous shade of crimson and he pulls back his lips to reveal razor sharp fangs. \"Yessss,\" the vampire hisses as he pounces on Fabrizio.  He sinks his teeth into the poor lad's neck and sucks every bit of blood from him.    When he has finished feeding the Count looks around the room for a place to dispose of the bellboy's pale, shriveled corpse.  Finding nowhere suitable he drags it out to the balcony and tosses it over the edge, before retreating inside to unpack.  Meanwhile, the rather disorientated tourist has managed to get to his feet and is brushing himself off when - SPLAT! - the corpse of Fabrizio hits him with the force of a freight train, knocking him down to the pavement once more.  In room 317 Dracula is hanging his spare capes in the wardrobe when he hears a timid knock on the door. \"Yessss?\" \"Housekeeping, sir.  Just wondered if you needed fresh linens.\"  Dracula opens the door and finds himself looking down upon a rather small, mousy-looking Italian girl in a maid's uniform.  Peering at her name-tag the Count says, \"Hello Eliza.  I am Count Dracula... prince of darkness, despoiler of virgins and scourge of all that is Holy.\" \"Pleased to meet you,\" Eliza replies.  \"Fresh linens?\" Dracula's gaze travels steadily up past the name-tag... coming to rest on the pale flesh of her delicate, exposed neck. \"Please... Do come in.\"  Outside the hotel, our unfortunate tourist is once again coming to his senses.  Sitting on the pavement with an aching head and two bloodless corpses at his side, he has almost gathered himself enough to go and get help when he hears a woman's terrified screams from somewhere above him.  Before he can react, however, the bone-white, shriveled-up corpse of Eliza the housekeeper has come plummeting down from the balcony of room 317 and landed on top of him with a sickening THUMP!  This time, however, there is a policeman nearby.    Witnessing the bizarre incident the policeman comes running over to see if the tourist is okay.  He helps the poor man to his feet and - noting the three victims of Dracula lying splayed at the tourist's feet - looks at the tourist, his face a mask of utter befuddlement. \"What on earth,\" the policeman asks, \"is going ON here?\" \"Well sir,\" the tourist replies. \"It goes a little something like this...\"  Then he begins to sing:  \"Drained wops keep falling on my head...\""}

When St. Peter showed up, they asked him. St. Peter said, \"I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,'\" and he left.  The couple sat and waited, and waited.

Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?\"   St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground.   \"What's wrong?\" asked the frightened couple.   \"OH, COME ON!,\" St. Peter shouted,   \"It took me three months to find a priest up here!

He was so obsessed infact that the thought of not living in a World centered around cheese was causing him anguish and he ended up breaking down crying, pleading to God to let him become one with cheese.  God saw this young boy sobbing about cheese and took pity on him and decided to grant him a wish. He came through to the boy and from the heavens said:   “Young man it is I, the one with the power to grant you anything your heart desires. What is it you wish for?”  The kid was shocked but happy and replied that he wanted his life to be completely centered around cheese.  God told him that his wish would be granted and while the boy was pleased he still felt doubts and couldn’t control the outburst of tears that were flowing down his face.   “I just want cheeeeseese and I don’t know that my life will consist of it to a high degree”  God: “don’t worry, things will only get cheddar”"}

In the women's room, the man is shocked to see a panel of buttons on the toilet stall wall. Overcome by curiosity, the man inspects the buttons closer. The first is labeled \"CW\"... seeing no harm, he presses it and much to his delight he is sprayed with cold water, and so he understands why it's labeled CW. It feels nice, so he makes his way down to the next button.  The next button reads \"WW\". Hoping for the best, he presses the button and his ass is greeted with warm water; ahh yes, WW, warm water. This feels even nicer and he's delighted to move down the list.  The next button is labeled \"WA\", which he excitedly presses and is dried off with some warm air. He's elated by this fancy toilet and takes a moment to enjoy this experience before pressing the final button.  The last button, labeled \"ATR\" beckons him to press it. Each previous button was an increasingly nice experience, so he's expecting ATR to be even better. Giddy with joy, he smiles and presses the ATR button. Suddenly, the man feels immense pain and then passes out.  The man wakes up a few hours later in a hospital, confused and very numb from the pain meds. He finds a nurse and begs to know what happened. The nurse explains, \"you were found passed out in the women's restroom.\" The man explains how the men's room was in use so he had to use the women's.  The nurse asks him, \"while in the women's restroom, you pressed the ATR button, didn't you?\" The man nods while displaying a look of confusion. The nurse looks back at him and says, \"ATR stands for automatic tampon remover. Your penis in under your pillow.\""}

I just knew the guy was in my apartment, but I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere and was just about to give up, when I went out on the balcony of my 23rd story apartment and there he was hanging over the edge! He was just barely hanging on, there was no way he could climb back onto the balcony. It was a really stupid place to try to hide. I was livid, so I started punching him and clawing at his fingers, but he held on. Finally I went to get a hammer and started pounding on his fingers, and he fell down. But what really angered me was that he landed in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! I was so mad I grabbed the refrigerator, threw it off the balcony and it landed on him. Unfortunately I was so riled up by the incident I had a heart attack and died.\"  St. Peter was taken aback, and said \"While you did die in a dramatic fashion, I think we need to look at that whole second degree murder before we let you in - off to limbo with you.\" He then approached the second man and asked him how he had died.  \"I was riding my exercise bike on the balcony of my 24th story apartment, when the thing broke and threw me over the railing! I grabbed furiously at the railing and slipped, but managed to catch on the balcony below mine. I tried to climb up but it just wasn't possible. I thought I was going to fall but then someone came out on the balcony. I thought he would help me, until he started hitting me! I held on as best I could, but when he got a hammer and started hitting me I finally couldn't hold on anymore and fell. Somehow, though, I fell in some bushes and fell to the ground dazed, but basically OK! Just as I'm coming around, I look up and BAM this refrigerator lands on me. So here I am.\"  St. Peter immediately admitted this second man to heaven, and pulled aside the third man and asked him for his story.  \"Picture this: I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator..."}

She simply could not bear the thought of being away from Mittens for a couple of months while they go and visit all the places in the world that they hadn't seen before.  Being wealthy, the husband came up with a plan. He employed a butler and made sure that the good man was a cat lover and instructed him to spend as much time as possible with Mittens to gain its trust. James the butler soon settled into the household and despite quite obviously not being the most intelligent, he performed his duties very well and did his part to give Mittens lots of attention and treats so that before too long the cat was quite fond of him.  Eventually the husband approached his wife and broached the subject of the two of them going on their long awaited world tour. At first the wife wouldn't hear a word of it, but he kept pointing out to her how fond Mittens had become of James and how attentive he was to the cat and telling her that James could phone them every morning and evening with a report on Mittens' well-being. Eventually he wore her down and she agreed that they could go on the trip.  For weeks before they were due to set off the wife drove James crazy with lists of instructions on how he should take care of Mittens, with daily schedules, when and how she should receive her favourite treats, down to the last detail.  Finally the day of their departure arrived. Just before they were about to leave the husband called James aside and said to him: Now remember, James, madam is extremely fond of Mittens, so you must please do your utmost to keep Mittens safe and happy. But please, just in case - heaven forbid - Mittens does pass away while we are away - Mittens is quite an old kitty by now after all - please, please don't just phone us and tell us that Mittens has died, because it will be the end of our trip and ruin our holiday that I have waited for so long. Rather, what you must do when you phone is to say, \"Mittens is on the roof, and she won't come down\", then I will know what has happened and I will slowly over the next few days prepare my wife and try and finish off our holiday as quickly as possible without completely ruining it. Do you understand, James?  To the husband's huge relief James confirmed: Yes sir, I understand, if Mittens dies, I must phone and say \"Mittens is on the roof and she won't come down\", and you will know what's happened.  At long last they set off on their long awaited trip. They visited every place that they had ever only seen in movies and books and travelled from country to country, visiting all the tourist sites, throughout Europe, across the Middle East, throughout Asia; they even went on safari in Africa. They were having a wonderful time. Twice a day James would phone and confirm that all was well with Mittens and the wife found that despite all her fears she was actually enjoying the trip.  Until one morning, when the phone rang as usual.   As usual the wife rushed to the phone to get the latest news of her beloved Mittens.  Sure enough, it was James calling, to tell her, \"Madam, your mother is on the roof and she won't come down.\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "[nsfw] Voodoo Dick (Long)  Lucia popped into her local South American produce shop on the way home from work (it was enchilada night). While browsing she got a call from her bff Natalie and spent some time talking about the recent divorce, and her lack of sex life. Shortly after hanging up, she was approached by the store clerk, a wizened old Peruvian lady.   \"Disculpa me, señora\" she said, \"I couldn't help overhearing, but I think I have a solution to your \"troubles\" if you'd like to follow me to the back?\".   Lucia's curiosity was piqued, so she followed the woman out to a dusty old storage room, filled with boxes, cobwebs, and a lazy looking pit-bull curled up in the corner.     \"This arrived the other day, from a small mountain village in Peru\" said the old woman, opening an old wooden box to reveal a smooth, phallic-shaped object, covered in strange markings and symbols. \"It was used to pleasure the old Mayan kings and queens, if rumours are true\".   \"It was called the Voodoo Dick\" said the woman. \"Very powerful!\". Lucia was unimpressed. \"I have a collection of vibrators at home\" she shrugged \"what use is another?\".   \"Not like this\", grinned the woman. \"Behold! Voodoo dick, the dog!\".  Suddenly, the Voodoo dick sprang out of the box, into the air, and sailed for the dog in the corner. It penetrated her with ease and began a powerful in-out motion. The dog was rendered almost immobile, though clearly overwhelmed with pleasure.  \"Voodoo dick, que pares ya!\" Said the woman, and the Voodoo dick returned obediently to it's box, much to the disappointment of the dog. \"Self-lubricating, self-loading and hands-free\" smirked the woman. Lucia was sold. \"I'll take it!\"   \"Very well! Simply command it where to go, and when you're finished, repeat \"Que pares ya!\" And it will return to it's box\".   Lucia returned home desperate to go e ir a try. She finally arrived, stripped and lay on the bed. \"Voodoo dick, my pussy!\"   The Voodoo dick sprung into action and Lucia was engulfed by wave after wave of the most intense pleasure she had ever experienced. She lost all track of time. Minutes turned to hours, or even days, who could be sure! Now experiencing some discomfort, she figured it was time to take a break.   But what was the fucking phrase!? The Voodoo dick had pounded the memory out of her, the stream of orgasms had left her mind completely blank. There was only one thing left to do. She waddled as fast as she could out to the car, and set off for the produce shop.   She was almost there, when suddenly a siren went off and she was forced to pull over. She tried her best to explain the situation to the officer. \"P.. please sir... mmm.... It's th-this v..uuuuu....Voodoo dick... I nee.... Need to go... Please!!...mmm\".  \"Yeah right lady\" scoffs the policeman.  \"Voodoo dick my ass...\"."}

He leapt up, ran over to Bruno and - summoning all his strength, caught the bouncer completely by surprise, knocking him out with one punch. The crowd - sensing the possibilities, began cheering him on, as they led him to the back kennel.  Once the door was shut, the crowd heard horrible growling sounds coming from the dog, punctuated, finally, by a loud *squeak*.  The door opened, and the man stepped out and said, \"Ok, now where's the woman with the bad tooth?\""}

On Marty's second birthday, his mom asked Marty what he wanted for his birthday. Marty said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" Mom was confused why Marty wanted pink ping pong balls but agreed to buy them for her son's sake.   Fast forward to Marty's 12^th birthday. Marty was treated to a surprise birthday party that he did not know about. He got cake and presents but was not satisfied. Marty's dad walked up to him and said, \"Marty, it doesn't seem like you want any of your presents. What would you like for your birthday?\" Marty said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" Dad thought this was just a phase that he is going through and agrees to buy such a weird item for his son's birthday.  Fast forward to Marty's graduation day. Marty was dressed all nice and his parents were taking photos of him. His parents wanted to get Marty anything he wanted, no matter the price. Marty looked at them and said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" Both parents looked at each other and agreed since it was such a special day. In their minds, however, they were wondering what Marty is doing with these ping pong balls.   Fast forward to Marty's wedding day. Marty is in his tuxedo with his newly wedded wife next to him. He sees his parents and his teenage brother grabbing some food. They see Marty and walk over to him. Marty's brother said, \"Congrats bro! For this special day, I will get you anything you want that is reasonable for me to afford. Quickly, Marty said, \"I want a pink ping pong ball!\" The brother was shocked and sort of weirded out by this request. Without complaint, he agrees.   Fast forward about 50 years later. Marty is on his hospital bed where the doctors say he is not going to make it. Marty is barely awake and his grandson is by his side. The grandson is crying and wants to ask a question to Marty. He says, \"Grandpa Marty, can you answer this one question that I have been meaning to ask you for years? Why did you always ask for a pink ping pong ball for a gift?\" Marty looks at him and says, \"Well my boy, it is because...\" And then he dies."}

Over a thousand people turned up, and they actually had to cordon off part of the Thames with a buoyed police rope due to the traffic we were generating!

I was a champion at this, and quickly set to work, but as I was mixing the concrete, my machine jammed! I was right by the waterfront, and as the spinning increased, the torque was so powerful that it blasted my shake mixer straight out the back of my shop window and into the river!  ...Well, not only did the agony end there, but a strange thing started to happen: due to the mixture of the ice cream base, the milk, and the water, a foam started developing that actually pushed the roped-off barrier in the Thames, buoys and all, up the dock!

A few years later, Avoh's success hadn't lessened, but to Jeff's great surprise, he was the one selected to lead the next grand ad campaign. Not one to look a gifthorse in the mouth, he ignored this and started to pick out his team. His choice was among all individuals not currently working on a campaign, including John Avoh. Taking him aboard would asure Jeff's first project to be a success, but at the same time, he would risk losing the credit for it, and John still was pretty creepy.    While pondering this on his way home for yoday, he came across a homeless person just outside his office building, who suddenly approached him asking \"Do you work in that bulding?\". Jeff replied: \"Yeah, why?\" The homeless man, looking sinister replied \"Beware the man named John Avoh, he literally steals the creativity of other people!\" Jeff was taken by this. On one hand this sounded crazy, on the otherhand, he had always seemed supernaturally successful and kind of creepy. He nervously asked: \"How do you know?\" and the bum replied:  \"I used to be in ad venture like you, but then I took Avoh on my team\""}

First or all why do you have this I'm sure its illegal for you to have him an remains in your home\"  Well......now this is just too much fun......  So, I replied, with this.....  Valerie, I’m glad you asked. It’s time I told the story.  Many years ago, my parents were quite poor. My dad owned a root vegetable farm growing potatoes, beets, turnips, rutabaga and such. My mom worked at the nursing home in town. We lived outside of Coopersville, a little farming town west of here in the nothing between Grand Rapids and Grand Haven. They had nothing, and their life was not an easy one.  As the leaves fell and they brought in the harvest of ‘74 my mom found out she was pregnant, with twins. If you’ve ever worked around nurses, well, this is like Christmas on a daily basis. They have baby rabies and go nuts over such things. Presents, a shower, it’s a whole thing. And TWINS no less, oh my god. My dad and his best friend build an addition on to the house, and builds a nursery with his own tools and his own hands.  On a beautiful spring morning, Saturday, May-31-1975 Peg (my mother) gives birth to a pair of healthy boys. 10 fingers, 10 toes, and the only way to tell them apart is one never shuts up, and one never makes a sound. They name the loudmouth Christopher (hi there), and the quiet one Peter.  We grew up typical american farm kids. Running in the fields, playing in the mud, poor but happy. My parents made sure we were fed and clothed and we were never want for anything. A simple life in a quiet town in a world before the internet. Summers on our bikes, and winters trudging the snow. We lived the kind of life where our idea of high entertainment was jumping out of the barn loft into the haystacks. Through all of it, we were inseparable. We did everything together.  Through all of it, Peter never really said a word. He wasn’t mute, he COULD talk, he just chose not to, especially around people. I was gregarious, a natural performer and always the center of attention. I’ve been the king of any room I walked into since I was a teenager. Peter, was always there, but always in my shadow. He seldom made a sound, and he spoke so rarely that I could count his vocabulary on my fingers. We called him “My quiet half”.  Still, this was our “normal”, and none of us really thought anything of it. We were 80’s kids, and medicine by today's standards was stone knives and bearskins.  In the late summer of 1991 we were helping with the harvest. To grow up on a farm is to be born into a life of strong muscles and an appreciation for hard work. We were harvesting Turnips, which are very dense and a full hopper weighs over 20 tons. Because of this they lurch and jump and twitch their way across the field. You’ve seen these being pulled behind tractors, they look like an upside down pyramid with a wheel on the side and a little hatch, and have an open top piled high with corn or whatever. We had 5 of them in a line behind an old International Harvester hydrostatic drive tractor.  I was driving the tractor across 60th from the West paddock (where we kept the cows) into the east field where we made the turn to go back to the drop pit to load the big truck that would haul all the turnips off to the broker that we sold them to. Pete was riding the pin and would release the load at the right time, one hopper after another, as we passed over the big grate. We’d done it a hundred times. It’s not the safest way to do it, but it’s what everyone does, because it’s hours faster than doing it “by the book”.  As we came over the ditch next to the corner of 60th and Garfield, the trailer jumped and Pete got knocked off. Five trailers, each in turn, brought their wheels across his abdomen and legs. He was shredded from the waist down. If he ever made a sound, I never heard it over the roar of the tractor. I didn’t even known he’d fallen off until I got to the barn and he wasn’t there.  I jumped out of the tractor and ran down the road, I saw him a quarter mile before I got to him, and that was the hardest run I’ve made in my life. From the waist up he looked totally fine, and below…..he looked like he’d sat on a grenade.  It took half an hour for the ambulance to get all the way out there, but it didn’t matter. There was no way he could survive that. He never cried, or screamed or anything. He simply whispered one word.  “Sorry”  September 26th, 1991 was when half of me died, my brother, my Twin. My quiet half, silenced forever.  In the process of cleaning him off the road, hauling him to the hospital, and all of the circus that goes with that, one of the Dr’s noticed that his heart was unusual. The left Atrium and Ventricle were about 3 times the size of the right. The right half of his heart was perfectly normal. The left had formed so large as to displace his lungs and his vocal cords. It was then that we learned that talking for Pete wasn’t just difficult, it was incredibly painful. We never knew. It was a simple birth defect, and today it would be easily treated, even without surgery. But back then, for simple farm folk, we never thought a thing of it. Think about it, do you know how big your heart is?  Hold your fists together. It’s about that big. Behind your sternum, and just a little to your left.  Pete, through a miracle of mortuary science, had a totally normal funeral with a half-open casket. Most of the people who came had no idea that there wasn't really anything under the closed half, but I had to take a peek after. I lifted the lid and, while I don’t know what the hell I expected to see, I wasn’t prepared for what I found. He was completely dressed, but the pants stopped just under his butt (about 2 inches past where you could see with the top half open). With only the top door open he looked totally normal. But open the lower half, and his pants were rolled up into little bundles and tucked neatly under him, where his legs would have started. Where his legs should have been, were just a series of jars. They had to bury as much of him as they could find, but they couldn’t put him back together, or didn’t take the time. It wasn’t as if he was going to get sewn back together be heal up or something. So most of his organs and such were in jars, sitting where his legs would have been. It wasn’t gross or anything, just simple glass jars with things floating in them.  I don’t know why I did it. But I had the whole place to myself, and I reached in, and picked up the jar holding his heart. I quietly closed the lid, said goodbye to my brother, and took it home with me.  I hid it, on the shelf in my closet, for years.  My mom came across it once, I told her it was from school for a science project and she said “Iew, gross” and went on with her day. Nothing was ever said about it after that, just another in the massive collection of weird things that was my room as a teenager.  As I write this, it’s 2016, and I have years on my back forty-one. Pete’s heart has been with me through my first love, college, and building a wild dream into a global empire. My quiet half. It’s time to let him go and make his own impact on the world.  Pete can live on, far longer than I will really, his giant heart will pass from student to student. Biological samples like this tend to never be actually opened. They are studied through the glass, and spend decades sitting on a shelf. Properly preserved his heart will remain intact for a hundred years after mine is turned back into fertile soil.  And that is the story of how I came to have the heart of a small boy, in a jar, on a table.  Or it could be that it’s a sheep’s heart that I got from a high school years ago with all the rest of those biological samples and we’re simply selling them to make space for new demonstrations and gear. It could be that I just made all of this up because it’s a nice quiet morning and perhaps I just like to mess with people that get all indignant on the internet.  And you believed it.  What….did you just fall off the fucking Turnip truck or something?"}

While he waits for his food, a handful of others come in looking as beleaguered as he feels. These new patrons sit down at nearby tables and place orders similar to that which the man made.  When the waitress returns from the bar she is followed by a man dressed in a gray military uniform with a swastika emblazoned on the arm. The nazi marches in step with the waitress as she delivers the drink orders to the man and the other patrons. They look at eachother quizzically while trying to avoid staring at the supposed nazi as he stand and salutes each time the waitress stops at a table and delivers a drink.  When the waitress and the nazi return to the kitchen, the man and the other patrons look at eachother, shrug, and hold their glasses up to eachother in recognition of their comradery in  the daily struggle that brought them all to this particular bar on this particular day.  After some time, the waitress returns with the food orders for the man and the other patrons. Once again, she is followed by the nazi, marching along behind her and saluting as she delivers the food and once again the men look at eachother, not sure how to react to this ridiculous sight. As the waitress delivers the man's food, he manages to shake his confusion long enough to order another drink.  Before digging in, the men briefly gesture to eachother indicating how odd it is to find a man in full nazi uniform following around a waitress. They then begin to eat in silence, each contemplating the drudgery they will face when they return to work tomorrow.   Suddenly, the man, lost in thought, is surprised by the waitress delivering his drink and as was apparently usual, the nazi standing behind her saluting. As the waitress starts to leave the man says, \"Excuse me miss? Why does a nazi follow you around when you deliver food and drink to tables?\" The waitress turns, flashes him a sunny smile, and says, \"Oh, don't mind him, he's just following orders.\""}

So, when her first child was born, she talked her husband into naming their daughter 'Love,' knowing that while the child might be teased, she would grow up stronger and thank her one day.  As expected, when Love started school, she endured much of the same teasing that Darling did, all because of her strange name.  One day, Love simply had had enough. She came home from school very angry and screamed at her dad, asking why her parents gave her such a stupid name.  The husband, being a good man, took the blame of naming her to protect his wife and apologized.  In a fit of rage, Love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.  Minutes later, Darling came home and saw her husband lying on the ground.  \"Omg, what happened?!\" she asked, running to him.

He knocks on the farmhouse door, the farmer opens it and invites him in. After picking out a box of a dozen eggs, the man caught a glimpse of a golden shine coming through a slightly opened door to his left. The man asks the farmer about the light and is taken aback when the farmer hurries over to the door and closes it. The farmer then says quickly that there is nothing important behind the door and goes back to selling eggs to the man before ushering him out of the front door.  The man goes home but curiosity gets the better of him and he breaks into the farmhouse that same night. After reaching the strange door, he slowly creaks it open and his jaw drops to the floor. The most beautiful and intricate throne sits in the centre of the room. A solid gold seat encrusted with gems polished to sparkle like stars. On this throne, to the surprise of the man, was just a one legged chicken.  A crash came from behind him as the man hears the farmers voice calling,  ‘Get out whoever you are, I’m armed and dangerous’  The man swings around and is face to face with a shotgun barrel.  ‘Please sir, don’t shoot’ says the man. ‘I was only curious about what was in this room. Why does this chicken have such a nice throne in a room if it’s own?’  The farmer lowers his shotgun and says to the man, ‘well this is no ordinary chicken you see. This is the most incredible chicken in the world. This chicken can walk around the house, cooking food, washing the dishes, cleaning my clothes, feeding the other chickens, collecting the eggs, raising the little chicks, it handles all of my finances, babysits for my children, repair all of my farm equipment. You name it he does it. Hell he even lays golden eggs and has saved my farm from bankruptcy many times. I keep him protected in this room because he’s so valuable.’  The man is astonished. He is lost for words and just stared at this chicken in awe. After a few moments the man comes to his senses, looks at the farmer and asks,  ‘But why does he only have one leg? was there a terrible accident or maybe jealous farmers trying to kidnap him? The poor creature, how could this happen?’  The farmer then replies, ‘well a chicken this good? You can’t just eat both legs, can you?’"}

And all of you sons of b*tches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks.\"   The mother went nuts and told her son, \"We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.\"   Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, \"All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.\"   She hears the little boy continue, \"For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat.   Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.\"   As the mother began to smile, the child added, \"For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the b*tch in the kitchen.\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "[NSFW] The black knight A man enters a bar in a small town he's passing through on one of his travels, and orders a beer. While he's not even halfway through his beer, the other guests suddenly scurry away, not even bothering to finish their drinks nor their conversations. At the same time, the bartender frantically starts to take down and secure all bottles of booze, obviously looking to close down shop in a hurry.   Our traveling stranger, bewildered, asks the bartender what's going on that has everyone so panicky. He answers: \"You really haven't heard? You must be from out of town. Everyone from around here knows that the black knight is coming!\". And with that, he disappears to a back section of the bar and barricades the door behind him.   Just moments after finding himself in this suddenly empty bar, a big black man walks into the bar. In fact, big is quite the understatement; he's absolutely enormous. He's about 7\"2 tall, has broad shoulders and muscular arms that give him a wingspan not unlike that of an Andean condor. Comically, the man is wearing black platform boots and a black top hat, making him look even bigger than he already is. Finishing his apparel are black pants, a black belt and a black shirt. The man - with the sort of strut as if he owned the place - walks straight towards the traveler, unzips his pants, whips out a massive dong and says in a deep commanding voice \"blow me\".  Mister traveler happens to be a heterosexual man, and even has a wife and two young kids at home. However, fearing what might happen to him if he refuses, he reluctantly complies. He starts working the tip slowly, but before long our antagonist spurs him to go \"faster, faster\". And so he does. Still not pleased with the pace of the performance, the black man keeps yelling \"faster, faster!\" another five times. After literally gobbling up and down as fast as he possibly can and hearing the repeated comment yet again, he starts losing his cool. He stops altogether, takes the dick out of his mouth and retorts: \"I've had it with you. I've been going as fast as I could and somehow you stíll want me to go faster. What's your big hurry anyways? \". To which the black man replies: \"What do you mean what's the hurry? Have you seriously not heard that the black knight is coming?!\"."}

If it starts raining and you don't have anywhere to shelter it, make sure you keep a tub of vaseline with you. Rub it all over the seat so the water will just bead off.\"  The guy takes his new bike and goes to pick up his girlfriend. The girlfriend invites the guy over to her parents house for dinner. This will be the first time he's ever eaten with her family.  \"I should let you know the rule of the table\" she said. \"There is no talking allowed. The first person to talk at the table has to clean the dishes.\"  The guy doesn't think this is that big of a deal until he arrives at the family's house and looks in the kitchen. There must be at least three months worth of dishes inside. They are stacked up to the ceiling, stinking and rotting of mold and old bits of food everywhere. The guy almost throws up at the smell and sight of such a disgusting state of affairs.  Dinner begins, and no one is saying a word. The tension is starting to get to the boyfriend, so he concocts a plan to make someone else speak first.  The guy drops his fork, goes over to his girlfriend at the table, throws her up on top and just starts fucking her in front of everyone. The father and mother are obviously mortified. But even with their jaws on the floor, no one says a word.  The guy stops and thinks to himself \"This is going to be harder than I thought....\" then he gets another idea.....  Without hesitation, he runs over to the mother throws her up on the table and fucks the shit out of her, right in front of the father.  The dad is staring daggers through the boyfriend and turning bright red in anger. But still says nothing. The girlfriend is becoming teary eyed and covering her mouth with her hands, but doesn't make a peep.  The boyfriend stops fucking the mother and sits back down at his seat, completely flustered. He takes a gander out the window, and notices a sudden heavy rain has settled in. He then realizes that his vintage motorbike is parked on the street, uncovered.  The boyfriend pops out of his seat and grabs his tub of vaseline. The dad jumps out of his chair and yells out, \"ALRIGHT, I'LL DO THE GODDAMNED DISHES!\"   Edit: A Classic Joke"}

She is leaving because it is best for both of them.  With that, she is gone.  Tom is heartbroken.  So he does what many do when they are down.  He heads to the bar to get drunk.      Tom has a few drinks, he's starting to mellow.  After a while he sees a pretty lady walk in and head straight to the bar and order a stiff drink.  He watches her for a bit, she's really preoccupied and keeps throwing them back.  He screws up his courage tries to talk her up.  They hit it off and sit down together for some more drinks.      She asks what his story was, why he was so down that he is here drowning his sorrows.  \"Well\", replies Tom, hanging his head, \"You are probably going to get up and walk out on me, but believe it or not, my girl just dumped me for being too kinky\"         \"Get outta HERE!\", she exclaims, \"You are NEVER going to believe this, but my man just took off because he did not like how crazy I was in bed.  I like to get freaky too!\"      Well naturally this really perks Tom up.  In fact, they are both pretty interested now.  They have a few more drinks and are really hitting it off.  Eventually, she leans in close, \"Hey...I'm having a lot of fun and we obviously have some things in common.  How about we head to my place and see what happens?\"      Tom is all for this and off they go.  At her place they get hot and heavy on her couch.  Suddenly she pulls away from him. \"Tom, why don't you sit and relax while I go slip into something a little more......adventurous???\"  She heads to her room, leaving Tom excited in the living room.      Once in her room she puts on a leather panties, a rubber bra with the nipples cut out, thigh high spiked boots, studded straps, and grabs a little whip.  She looks at herself in the mirror and is pleased with herself.  She heads out and grabs a ball gag from the drawer on the way.         She glides into the living room ready to get down and dirty.  She sees Tom putting on his jacket and heading for the door.         \"HEY!!! Where are you going?

Luckily for me I grab the ledge under me thinking I'm safe I try to climb up when I realize I can't, I began to worry but luckily a man came out on the balcony, but my joy turned to horror when the man started screaming at me and kicking my fingers, and then he come out with A HAMMER and start hitting my fingers with it and I fell. Some how I barely survived the fall be landing on a tree and I thought my trials were over, AND THEN a refrigerator falls on me out of nowhere.\"   St. Peter ( knowing the whole story) thought this was sad so he let the man in. The third man walks up and St. Peter asks him his story and the man replies \"Picture this, you're hiding in a refrigerator...\""}

Following the voice he finds a man fallen into his trapping pit.  The man says: \"Oh boy friend, am I glad to see you! Please, could you help me out of this hole I fell into?\"  The trapper helps him out of the pit.  Man asks: \"How can I repay you for saving me?\"  Trapper thinks a bit and says: \"Well, times are kind of tough right now, the animals are scarce and rare to find, so I could always use some spare cash for supplies and food and a rare bottle of booze.\"  The man replies: \"Well, friend, you know, I feel it is not right to  just give you some money. This may help right now, but when it is spent you will be in the same situation in the long run. But this is your lucky day. I am the CEO of Chrysler Corporation and I bet that if I put in a good word for you, you will land a well-paying job as a welder. It should be quite easy, you can learn it on-site and it pays well.\"  &#x200B;  So the trapper travels to Detroit with the CEO who lands him the job. As he goes to personnel office to finish the deal he is asked to sign the contract.  Unfortunately he tells them that he cannot write.  The HR department (who have no idea about the deal with the CEO) tell him that they are unable to hire a person who has not even learned to sign his name. So he returns home and continues to make his living as a trapper.  &#x200B;  A decade later he again finds a man fallen into his trapping pit. (This time it is a different man of course)  Again he helps him out and the man asks how could he repay the trapper.  And, again, he opts to ask for some money.  &#x200B;  This time the man is a billionaire (bitcoin or Apple stocks or whatever, does not matter from the storytelling point, the trapper did not bother to  ask), so he simply takes his checkbook and writes him a check for a million dollars pronto.  The trapper goes to the bank on his first opportunity and wants to cash the check.  The clerk prepares the paperwork and asks for the trapper to sign them.  The trapper tells her: \"I'm sorry dear, I cannot write, I have never learned how\"  The clerk says in wonder: Wow, you are a millionaire and can't even write down your own name! Think where you might be if you could write!\"  &#x200B;  The trapper answers: \"Hell, girl, I know exactly where I would be. In Detroit, a welder in a Chrysler factory.\"  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  P.S.

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "So...I’m (male) at Gap shopping for clothes back in senior year of high school...(long) ...looking for some clothes for college. I’m in the midst of picking out a new pair of pants, when out of the corner of my eye, I notice a middle-aged woman staring at me from the other side of the store. I ignore it briefly, and continue looking for my clothing purchases.   10 minutes later, I notice that she’s still randomly looking over at me, so I begin to stare back. Then, all of a sudden, she walks over to me.   Her: “I’m sorry to be staring at you like that.”  Me: “It’s ok, I guess.”  Her: “It’s just crazy though. You look just like my son!”  Me: “Ooh, ok.” And think, well, I guess that makes more sense. But then she goes:  Her: “But he died 3 months ago.”  Me: “Wow, I am so sorry...”  Her: “No, no. It’s totally fine. It’s just nuts how much you look like him. Can you do me a favor?”  Me: “What’s that?”  Her: “When I leave the store, can you wave goodbye to me and say “Bye Mom”? It would really help...you know...for uh, closure?”  So I think to myself, in the heat of the moment, I guess I’ll do the nice thing in this incredibly awkward situation and just go along with it. So I say:  Me: “Sure.”  So I continue seeking out my purchases and end up selecting one shirt and one pair of jeans. I get to the counter to pay, and she happens to be right in front of me in line. She grabs her bags of clothes and heads to the end of the store, by the exit. And stands there. Waiting. I actually have to do this....  So, I wave to her and mouth the words “Bye Mom”.   She nods her head in thankfulness, turns around, and walks away.   I’m still sitting there in a bit of shock at the whole situation. All of a sudden, the person ringing me up says:  Cashier: “Your total is $811.37.”  Me: “Wait, what?”  Cashier: “Your total is $811.37.”  Me: “But...all I bought was a pair of pants and a shirt!”  Cashier: “Well, wasn’t that your mom?”  Me: “Uh, why?”  Cashier: “Well, she told me she had to get to an appointment but that you were her son, and you would pay for her stuff.”  So then it all clicks for me, and I go:  Me: “Sir, I’ll be right back!!”   And I start running out of the store trying to find her. We’re in a mall, so I begin running as fast as I can for the nearest exit. I get there and I see her (with her four bags), and she sees me. She had a car waiting, engine on and everything. She throws the bags into the backseat, and opens the front door. She goes to sit down in the front seat, and before she can close the door, I run as fast as I can, and I jump and start pulling on her leg just like I’m pulling on yours!   *(Joke works best in person, when they believe it actually happened to you)*"}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "The pink ping pong balls There was once a boy. He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,  \"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?\"  His son replied.  \"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.\"  His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.  \"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?\"  \"Okay son, go ahead.\"  The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.  On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.  \"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"  His son replied.  \"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.\"  His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.  \"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?\"  The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.  On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.  \"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"  \"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.\"  Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.  \"My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?\"  His son replied.  \"My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.\"  His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.  \"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?\"  The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.  The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.  \"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"  \"Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.\"  The father was very confused by this and had to ask again.  \"My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?\"  His son replied.  \"My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.\"  His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.  \"My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?\"  Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.  Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.  \"My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?\"  The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.  \"My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...\"  His father replied.  \"My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?\"  \"Alright father. Come closer.\"  His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.  \"The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-\"  And then he died."}

It’s been there for years, and nobody’s been able to complete it.”  The man, now with his interest piqued, asks the bartender, “Well lemme hear it. I bet whatever it is, if I’m leaving with a fat wallet it’ll be worth it.”  The bartender, gives the man a serious look in his eyes. “You sure about this?”  The man nodded. “I’m ready.”  The bartender then began explaining the challenge to the man. “There’s three parts to this challenge. Sitting on that ledge there is a bottle of Jack Daniels. First, you have to chug that, no pausing, no burping.”  The man, listening closely, gives the bartender a nod.  “Second,” the bartender continued, “There’s a rabid dog out back. You have to wrestle it and pin it within fifteen minutes. Naturally, this is where most people fail.”  The man, slightly nervous, nods yet again. “Go on.”  The bartender continued. “Lastly, there’s an Eskimo Woman upstairs. If you can get her to have sex with you, the money is yours.”  The man, now intent on getting the money, immediately runs over to the ledge, opening the bottle of Jack Daniels. He chugs it down as the rest of the bar silently watches, before slamming the empty bottle back down with watery eyes. The bartender points him to the back door, where he stumbles over to before heading out back.  Before long, the horrible sounds of the man yelling and groaning can be heard, only drowned out by the louder barks and growls of the rabid dog. The sounds go on for about ten minutes as the bar patrons and the bartender all watch the back door intently, prepared to dial 911 before everything in the back goes silent and the man stumbles back inside, his clothes torn, covered in blood and bruises. He looks at the bartender, and asks with slurred speech:  “Now where’s that Eskimo Woman I’m supposed to wrestle?”"}

Mr Paul Yankee and Mrs Wendy Yankee decided to go to Jamaica for their honeymoon. As a surprise for his wife, he got a tattoo on his penis to demonstrate his undying love and loyalty for her. When it's erect, it says WENDY, and when flaccid it says WY, her initials.  Night time arrived on the first day, and as Paul disrobed, Wendy's jaw dropped. She loved the surprise so much and they had sex for three straight days, surviving on room service and bar snacks.  Finally they decided to hit the beaches. It was a really hot day and after enjoying the cool ocean water, they decided to sit at the bar under the straw hut.  They started to knock back a few Long Islands and other refreshing cocktails and they had a great time.  Good ol' Paul excused himself from the missus and decided to take a leak. The queue for the restroom by the bar was too long, so he ran further up and saw the Department of Tourism building.   He was about to burst, and hopping side to side, he asked the receptionist where the restroom is. \"Take a left turn down there\" she barely said in her thick Jamaican accent before Paul jetted off and entered the restroom.  At the urinal, he noticed that this tall dark Jamaican man has on his penis, the letters WY tattooed.   \"How peculiar\", thought Paul.  Curiously, Paul told the gentleman that he is on his honeymoon and as a surprise for his newly wed wife, he had her name on his penis tattooed to show his undying love and eternal loyalty to her. Paul then asked him \"So do you also have a wife named Wendy?\".  The man replied,  \"No, I work in the Tourism department, so it says WELCOME TO JAMAICA, ENJOY OUR BEACHES AND HAVE A NICE DAY\""}

Over the later days, he began to become erratic, asking Scientists, Men of God and even random strangers what they thought the purpose of living is. Unsatisfied with all his answers, he climbs to the side of a bridge in hopes of throwing himself off. His feet where on the edge and he was about to jump when and old man taps his side and says to him   “Do not jump. I know the answers you seek. Look to the stars and continue onwards”   The old man the shuffled off without another word. With renewed hope swelling in his chest, he gathers all his life savings and builds a rocket ship. Tirelessly, he worked day and night for many, many years until it was finished.   Immediately he jumped in and launched off towards the stars, aimlessly wandering space for so long that he forgot, until he landed on another planet inhabited by alien creatures.   Clambering out of the ship, he desperately asked each alien who came across his path   “Do you know? Do you know the purpose of living?”   The alien creatures could not understand what he was saying, but understood that glint of questions in his eyes like so many others that have come past. They pointed him to a nearby comet that was orbiting the planet. He climbed back into the rocket and shot off to the comet.   Upon landing, he realises that the ball of ice is completely barren, so he then decides to dig.   So he digs and he digs and he digs, but the Redditor was now an old man and those years of searching where finally taking his toll on him.   But as he gets to the center, he finds a piece of parchment with something written on it. The Redditor could feel that these were his last breaths but he was so close to the answer that plagued him his entire life.   The parchment simply read   “OP’s Mom”   The Redditor gave a faint chuckle   “The real joke is always in the comets”"}

It is quite late so the sisters are sleeping right now.\" And saying so, completely butt naked, off the priest went to fetch a pair of soaps bars.  Coming back, passing through a big hallway full of priest statues, he suddenly hears three sisters coming from a night walk and chit-chatting down the hallway. The priest is now desperate.   \"Lord! What do I do?! What do I do?!\" - he desperately thought. The sisters were getting close. There was no time to run back.  Then he had an idea. Pretending he was a statue, he quickly struck a pose and froze there, near the other real statues, holding one soap bar in each hand.  \"They will never notice me!\" - he thought.  When the sisters passed by him, one of the sisters stopped walking.  \"Sisters\" - she said - \"have you ever noticed this statue before?\"  \"It is so realistic!\" - said the second one.  \"And...

There were a  lot of guys, so I’m not really sure which one is the father.” The doctor goes back to work and the girls continues to push. When the baby comes out the doctor says “I don’t know if this will help you narrow down who the father is, but the baby is black” The girl replies “That does help, there was only one black guy there” The doctor then adds “This may complicate it a bit, but the baby has blonde hair” The girl replies “Well there was one big Norwegian guy so that also makes sense” Again the doctor adds “The baby has small slanted eyes” The girl says “Well there was one Chinese guy in there too so I guess that makes sense too” Suddenly the baby begins to cry. The girl is overcome with relief. The doctor asks “Why are you so relieved to hear the baby cry?” The girls answers “I thought it was going to bark”"}

She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.  'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'  The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!

The first mate, worried about what was to come, informed the captain about the pirate ship.   \"Captain! There's a ship filled with armed pirates! We have to surrender!\"  \"No!\" The captain said. \"Fetch me my red shirt, and we will fight back!\"  The first mate, despite being confused, had faith in the captain, and hence fetched the red shirt. The captain put it on, and they went to battle. The crew fought valiantly, and surprisingly, they won!  A few weeks passed of peaceful fishing, until one day, another pirate ship appeared. Even bigger than the last! The first mate, yet again warned the captain.  \"Captain!! There's no way we can beat them! Their ship is way too big!\"  \"No!\" The captain bellowed. \" Fetch me my red shirt, and we will fight back.\"  The first mate reluctantly agreed, and off they went to battle. Surprisingly, they won the fight again!  The first mate, impressed but also confused by these events, confronted the captain.  \"How do we manage to win every fight? Does it have something to do with the red shirt?\"  The captain replied. \"Oh, you see, I wear the red shirt so that when I am wounded, our crew doesn't see me bleed, making them more confident in me, helping us win the fights!\"  The first mate was impressed. His captain was so brave! Hence he no longer felt any doubt in his captain.  A few months passed after these events, until one day, and entire fleet of pirates arrived, all ready to pillage the small ship. The first mate, already mentally prepared for this, told the captain.  \"Would you like me to fetch you your red shirt?\"  \"No.\" The captain replied. \"Fetch me my brown pants.\""}

The kit that Micheal Sr had bought was missing the net. I mean sure, his son could still play, but there would be no satisfying swish.  So, Micheal Sr looked all over for anything he could use for a net, but alas he found nothing. Then, as he was walking down the street, he saw a garbage truck pass, and in the back of the truck, there it was. A net, a mesh of gray string that no doubt he could use.  He waited until the truck stopped and discreetly took the net from the back.   When Micheal Jr came back home. He saw a note from his father on the front door saying: *Micheal, Go to the backyard*.  No sooner did Micheal step onto the patio did his father pass him a ball. Micheal looked at the ball, then his father, then at the hoop behind him.  Micheal's father spoke: \"Look at this net, that I just found. When I say go, be ready to throw.\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "A brilliant meteorology professor goes to Nebraska. There was this brilliant meteorology professor who lived in Chicago. Every day was the same for him. He left his house at 8 AM every morning, went to the university, taught about the weather, then came home. OF course, he did go shopping and whatnot when needed, but that was the basis of most days. And he went to parties and played golf on occasion, but that was very rare. One day, his good friend invited him to Nebraska. The professor *was* pretty bored, so he decided to go. At 11 AM sharp the next day, he was to get on a flight to Nebraska.  He woke up more alive than normal. He brushed his teeth vigorously for the dentist-recommended 2 minutes, with his Oral-B toothbrush and Colgate toothpaste. He loved the artificial mint flavor of Colgate. He took a Lyft to the airport and got there in under 30 minutes. He handed out a generous 22% tip and headed inside the airport. Once on the plane, he realized that the pilot was exceptional; a virtuoso, even. It was a smooth flight until they got near Nebraska. Even this pilot could not avoid turbulence with the colossal, raging storm outside. Luckily, the landing was uneventful. The professor waded his way through the airport and found his friend. This friend lived out in the empty fields of Nebraska.   The professor decided that he wanted to shoot a bird. The friend thought it was a good idea. But the professor had forgotten all about the storm on the way into Nebraska. So, the meteorologist and the farmer headed out to an empty field to shoot birds. The friend, of course, was able to shoot a respectable number of birds. The professor held no such skills in his own repertoire. He was far too busy watching the dark clouds form above. After all, his job was to teach others to do the same. He figured they had time before the clouds opened up. He was wrong. Suddenly, the heavens poured forth a torrent unlike any that the professor had ever seen. A nearby tree ruptured with the force of lightning. The professor screamed over the wind: “Let us vacate this area! It’s too much of a storm to handle!” The ardent farmer did not want to go home without one more bird. The professor kept insisting that they leave. The farmer then asked, “*How* do you know that we must leave?” The professor replied, “I know we must leave because I am an expert in this field!”"}

There is a man that shows up every night with his wheelbarrow to drag drunk people off into the night and molest them!”  The tourist guy gets scared, pays his tab and exits the bar. This is when he realizes that he never kept track of how much he had been drinking and unbeknownst to him, he was pretty much too far gone. He walks a little, gets tired and decides to take a break. He sits down and rests his head against the wall of a building and passes out.  Moments later, he wakes up and sees that he’s clearly being carried in a wheelbarrow. He freaks out and starts yelling at the man, “what the hell! Where are you taking me!?  The man carrying him in the wheelbarrow suddenly dumps him off and replies back to him as he runs away, “I’m not taking you anywhere, I’m already bringing you back!  The tourist tries to get himself to his feet. He can feel that he is in fact, completely wasted and there is also a throbbing pain in his ass. He contemplates what just happened and whimpers to himself, “well that’s two things off the bucket list now.”"}

So, this doesn't work here, but I figured I'd post it as it's a good joke to have in the bag for when you're with a group of friends, or as an icebreaker at a bar or gathering or something. It's the long-story format, so you can adlib as much as you like to extend it a bit, but I'll give the framework.   You identify the person you want to execute the joke on, and learn their name if you don't know it. It works best if everyone there also knows that person's name. They'll be the target.   Edit: your target should be a gender that has a penis. Forgot to add that. Otherwise, adjust the joke for similarly embarrassing body parts that they have.   Begin: Three men have been best friends their entire lives, and after their 60yr doctor checkups, all find out they have terminal -insert illness here-. (I usually go with ass cancer, but obv depends on your audience). They find out they all only have a few months to live.   Sitting around drinking, they decide that they need to do something with their lives so that they can be remembered forever.   I've got it! Says the first friend. Let's all try and get into the Guinness book of world records! I've got (pick a body part) really long arms, maybe the longest in the world, I'll submit that!   The second guy thinks a bit, and says \"hey yeah, I've got a huge nose! Maybe it's the longest in the world, I'll submit that!\"   Third guy thinks for a really long time. Finally, he sadly admits \"well... I've got a tiny, tiny penis. Maybe it's the smallest penis in the world. I guess I'll submit that.\"   So, they send off their applications and wait. A few weeks pass, and they get back together because the new edition finally arrived.   Shaking with anticipation, the second guy says \"go on! Open it, let's see if we made history!\"   First guy slowly opens, flips to the arms section, and cheers. \"Yes! I've got the longest arms in the world!\"   Second guy grabs the book. \"let me see!\" He flips to the nose section, and shouts \"Woo! I've got the biggest nose in the world!\"   Last guy slowly reaches out and takes the book. He resignedly flips to the penis section, and stares at it - then suddenly, angrily shouts   \"Who the fuck is (your target's name)??\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "Meta-meta-joke # Joke  A joke is something funny because unpredicatable that makes people laugh, giggle or smile. This is a a joke :  &#x200B;  >I met a shepherd, we talked about ewe.  &#x200B;  The fact that it takes a second to realize that \"we talked about ewe\"  sounds like the well known sentence that rings a bell in your head \"we talked about you\", makes your brain uncomfortable because the concepts mismatch. The result is a good laugh (or again, maybe just a giggle).  # Meta-joke  A meta-joke is a joke *about* jokes. It should still be as funny as a joke, but includes the concept of someone telling a joke. For instance:  &#x200B;  >Jim's friend tells him:   >   >\"I have a joke for you: how many eggs can you eat in the morning, on an empty stomach?\"   >   >\"I don't know\", answers Jim, \"I'd say a dozen\".   >   >\"No, just one!\" answers his friend. \"After that, you're not on an empty stomach anymore!\"   >   >\"Funny one!\" answers the man, \"I'm going to tell it to my wife!\"   >   >So Jim goes home and tells his wife: \"Honey, how many eggs can you eat on an empty stomach?\"   >   >\"I don't know\", answers his wife, \"I'd say 3 or 4\".   >   >\"Too bad\" says Jim, \"If you had answered «a dozen», I would have had a funny joke for you\".  &#x200B;  Here, we can see that Jim's understanding of the joke was too literal. Again, even though his friend's joke is well known, the fact that Jim didn't see he could still tell it to his wife is unexpected. Your brain knows it (unless you're like Jim) and *you* get the joke on a second level. Meta-joke… **BOOM!**  # Meta-meta-joke  Obviously, a meta-meta-joke (yes, we're finally here) is a joke about a meta-joke.  This time, before I tell you that joke, I must tell you three meta-jokes that you may know of. They all look similar, so I'll only add a new punchline to each subsequent meta-joke.  >In a family, they tell so many jokes that they ended up numbering them. It is often heard, at a family dinner, that the grampa says \"Hey, guys, listen to that one: 78!\" and every one starts laughing.   >   >But one day, little Bobby, who doesn't really understand what's going on, wonders what's that funny. He finally builds up some courage and shouts to everyone: \"43!\"   >   >His mother's hand falls on his cheek with a big smack and she tells him: \"Bobby, where did you learn those kind of words?\"  &#x200B;  Now for the second joke:  &#x200B;  >In the same family, there is a guest the next day. Just as Bobby, he's completely oblivious of the meaning of those numbers. As an adult, he politely asks his hosts what was going on and they explain to him.   >   >\"Can I try?\" he asks.   >   >\"Why of course, dear\" says the granny.   >   >\"Ok, let's go… 31\".   >   >No one laughs. The guest asks \"why isn't anyone laughing?\"   >   >\"Well\", answers the father, \"apparently you don't know how to tell a joke\".  &#x200B;  And the last one:  &#x200B;  >A month later, the same guest is invited again to dinner. This time, just before the dinner starts, he tells everyone: \"OK, people, I practiced and I'm ready to tell you a joke.\"   >   >Everyone is intrigued and listens to him. Taking a deep breath, the man shouts: \"112\".   >   >After a few seconds of silence, every other person starts laughing frantically, one of those never ending laughters that almost makes you uncomfortable.   >   >\"Why are you laughing so hard?\" he asks.   >   >Trying to speak as she could, the mother answers: \"That's a joke we never heard before!\"  &#x200B;  You know have three nice looking (and quite similar) meta-jokes. Now here is a meta-meta-joke:  &#x200B;  >Kyle asks a friend: \"do you know the joke about the family who knows so many of them?\"   >   >His friend answers: \"Which one do you mean? Number one, number two or number three?\"  &#x200B;  I'm sorry, but I lied to you… this (I mean all this) is actually a meta-meta-meta-joke! That should at least make you giggle."}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "Christmas heart good intention avoided disaster In Starbucks, waiting for my wife to finish getting her Christmas massage. Yes, I'm such a great husband. In fact, I'm also a great person. I noticed a guy without food or drink sitting in a chair near the entrance. He had a shaved head, shabby clothes, and while looking a little suspicious, I had some unexpected compassion for him. Why would I consider him when I only wanted to fuel up on caffeine and social media? By the look of this guy, I assumed he is often judged and discounted by others. It quickly went through my mind to go over, strike a conversation, and offer to get him something to eat or drink. You know, to share the Christmas blessing many of us have in a warm home, with a family we love, and way too many presents to know what to do with on this day, Dec 26. After all he's probably been through a lot... Building up courage to go over and talk to him, It was then that I was humbled and quite relieved by the Starbucks batista who interrupted my moment of altruistic thinking. She walked up to the guy, him smiling back and standing up from his chair, they walked right out the entrance holding hands together. That shady, homely guy without food or family, joyfully walked out of Starbucks to enjoy the rest of his day with his girlfriend. 😥 Merry Christmas everybody! Be kind and try to avoid embarrassing yourself this holiday. 😓🤐😝"}

One turns to the other and says: \"You know last week I discoveredthat if you jump from the top of this building-by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window.\" The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar. The 2nd Man says: \"What are you a nut? There is no way in hell that could happen.\" 1st Man:  \"No it's true let me prove it to you.\"  So he gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens to the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar. The 2nd Man tells him: \"You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke.\" 1st Man: \"No, I'll prove it again\" and again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it. 2nd Man: \"Well what the hell, it works, I'll try it.\" he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors... and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'  Back upstairs the Bartender turns to the other drinker: \"You know, Superman, you're a real asshole when you're drunk.  (2)A drunk was walking down the beach when he came across a genie lamp. Being somewhat skeptical, the drunk half-heartedly rubbed the lamp. To his amazement there was a puff of blue smoke, and a genie appeared! \"You now have one wish\", said the Genie. \"But I thought I got three\", protested the drunk. \"You've been watching too much TV\" said the genie. \"Now make it quick!\" \"In that case, I'll take a MILLION BUCKS!\" In an instant there was another puff of smoke and the genie, as well as the lamp, were gone. Surrounding the drunk were ducks, as far as the eye could see. First furious, then utterly depressed, the drunk walked aimlessly for miles down the beach followed by an endless procession of ducks. Finally, in the distance, he saw the bright neon lights of an ocean-side bar.  \"Now, that's what I need!\" he thought to himself. And, doing what came naturally, he went inside to drown his sorrows. As he sat down at the bar another gentleman, noticing the ducks, said \"Hey pal, what gives?\" \"Oh this stupid genie is hard of hearing! I actually asked for a million BUCKS!\" \"I see\", said the second man. \"You know, I once found a genie lamp too!\" \"Really?\" said the drunk. \"What did you get?\" The second man pulled a small piano out of his pocket, then a miniature stool. Finally he took a one-foot-tall man out of his pocket who sat down and started playing bar songs. \"That's something else! But why did you ask for that?\" inquired the drunk.  \"Come on...\" responded the second man, \"You don't REALLY think I asked for a 12-inch pianist do you?\"  (3) A drunk goes in a bar and asks for a shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk pushes it aside and asks for another shot of Jim Beam. The bartender pours it and the drunk drinks it. The bartender says, \"I watched what you did and I don't understand why you pushed the first one away and drank the second one!\" The drunk stated,\" I've been going to those AA Meetings, and they said WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST DRINK!!!\".  (4)A drunken guy was driving down a one way street the wrong way, a cop stopped him and asked \"didn't you see the arrows?\" The drunk driver replied \"Arrows, Hell I didn't even see the Indians.\"  (5)Staking out a notoriously rowdy bar for possible drunk drivers, a cop watched from his squad car as a fellow stumbled out the door, tripped on the kerb and tried 45 cars before opening the door to his own and falling asleep on the front seat. One by one, the drivers of the other cars drove off. Finally, the sleeper woke up, started his car and began to leave. The cop pulled him over and administered a Breathalyzer test. When the results showed a 0.0 blood-alcohol level, the puzzled policeman asked him how that was possible.\"Easy,\" was the reply. \"Tonight was my turn to be the decoy\".  (6)Three guys come into work Monday morning, each bragging about how drunk they were over the weekend. The first says, \"I was so drunk Saturday I was blowing chunks all night.\" The second says, \"That's nothing. I was so drunk that I blacked out, tried to drive home, and wound up spending Sunday in jail.\" The third then says \"Big deal. I got so drunk this weekend that I picked up a hooker, brought her home, and was banging her on the kitchen counter when my wife walked in on us.\" The first guy then interupts and says, \"But you dont understand... Chunks is my dog.\"  (7)A drunk was walking along the beach when he saw a bottle. He stopped and rubbed it and a genie popped out. \"You have 3 wishes\" said the genie. The alcholic said, \"I'll take a bottle that is never empty.\" Whamo he has a bottle that is never empty and starts to drink. The genie taps him on the shoulder and says, \"and what are your other two wishes?\" \"Oh,\" says the alcoholic, \"I'll have two more like this one.\"  (8)One day in Dodge City, a cowboy rides into town. He pulls up outside the saloon, gets off of his horse, and ties him up to the hitchin post. He then walks around back of it, lifts the tail and kisses the horses backside with puckered lips. He then walks into the saloon. Across the street an oldtimer can't believe what he has just seen, so he rushes across the street and bursts into the saloon where he sees the cowboy drinking at the bar. \"Hey mister\" he says, \"did you just kiss your hoss' ass?\" \"Yup\" says the cowboy. The oldtimer says, \"if you don't mind me askin, why'd you do that? \"Cuz I got chapped lips,\" says the cowboy \"And kissin your hoss' ass cures chapped lips?\" \"Nope\" says the cowboy, \"but it sure keeps me from licking them.\"  (9)Two rednecks, Bubba and Gator, were driving down the road drinking a couple of bottles of bud. The passenger, Bubba,said. \"Lookey thar up ahead, Gator, it's a po-lice roadblock! We're gonna get busted fer drinkin these here beers!! \"Don't worry Bubba\" Gator said. \"We'll just pull over and finish drinkin these beers, peel off the label and stick it on our foreheads, and throw the bottles under the seat\". \"What fer?\" Asked Bubba. \"Just let me do the talkin okay?\" Said Gator. Well, they finished their beers,threw the empty bottles under the seat, and each put a label on their forehead. When they reached the roadblock, the sherriff said, \"You boys been drinkin?\". \"No sir\" Gator said. \"We're on the patch.\"  (10)If you're not supposed to drink and drive, why do bars have parking lots?  (11)A bloke goes into a pub, takes a seat at the bar, and orders five pints. The barman gives him an odd look since the bloke's all by himself, but he serves up the five pints and lines them up on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four, Five. He finishes the last one and calls to the barman, \"Four pints, please, mate!\" The barman serves up four pints and lines them on the bar. The bloke downs them....One, Two, Three, Four. Then he belches loudly, sways slightly on the stool, and orders three more pints. And one after the other, he knocks them back.... One, Two, Three. \"Two pintsh, mate!\" he calls, and the barman places two pints in front of him. Down they go.... One, Two. As the bloke slams the last one down on the bar, he says, \"One pint, mate.\" So the barman fills the glass. The bloke sits there, staring at it for for a moment, trying to focus. Then he looks at the barman and says, \"Y'know, it'sh a funny t'ing, but the less I drink, the drunker I get...\"  (12)A drunk gets up from the bar and heads for the restroom. A few minutes later, a loud, blood curdling scream is heard. A few minutes after that, another loud scream reverberates through the bar. The bartender goes to investigate.  \"What's all the screaming about in there? You're scaring my customers!\"  \"I'm just sitting here on the toilet and every time I try to flush, something comes up and sqeezes the hell out of my balls,\" replies the drunk.  With that, the bartender opens the door, looks in and says, \"You idiot! You're sitting on the mop wringer bucket!\"  (13)Two drunks were walking along a railroad track. One says, \"All these stairs are killing me.\" The other says, \"It's not the stairs that kill me, it's these low railings.\"  (14)A man walks into a bar and notices a 100-dollar bill in a frame above the bar.  He asks the barkeep, \"Was that the first hundred you made?\" \"No\", replied the bartender.  \"That's for a contest we have but no one's ever won.\" \"I want to play\", said the man. \"Well\", said the barkeep, \"There are three parts to this contest:  The first thing you have to do is knock out that bouncer over there.  Only one man has ever done that.  The second thing you have to do is go out back.  I have a pit-bull out there with a loose tooth.  You have to pull that tooth out.  The guy who knocked out my bouncer ended up in the hospital when he tried that one.  Finally, you have to make love to that 400-pound woman sitting at the back of the bar. \"Upon hearing the third requirement, the man said \"No thanks, I'll pass\".  However, after a good amount of drinking the man reconsidered and yelled to the barkeep \"Bring it on!  What's first?\" \"The bouncer\" said the bartender.  Upon hearing this, the man promptly walked over to the bouncer and laid him out with one punch. \"Impressive! Now for the pit-bull\", said the bartender. The man went out back.  For about five minutes all that could be heard was barking and crashing, and finally a dog's whimper.  The man walked back into the bar proudly and, zipping up his pants, said \"Now where's that fat bitch with the loose tooth?\"  (15)This really drunk guy walks up to a parking meter and puts in a quarter. He stares at the needle that has stopped at 60 and exclaims, \"I can't believe I lost 100 pounds!\"   (16)What's the difference between a bar and a g-spot? Most men have no trouble finding a bar.   (17)Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder...  (18)What would you call a drunk who works at an upholstery shop? A recovering alcoholic.    (19)Two friends were out drinking when suddenly one lurched backward off his barstool and lay motionless on the floor. \"One thing about Jim,\" his buddy said to the bartender, \"He knows when to stop.\"   (20)There was a guy who had at least 4-5 drinks of whiskey every day of his adult life. When he died, they cremated him, and it took two days to put out the fire!   (21)How do you know that a female bartender is pissed off with you? There's a string hanging out of your Bloody Mary.   (22)Where does an Irish family go on vacation?  A different bar.   (23)What is the difference between an Irish wedding and an Irish Funeral? One less drunk.  (24)How many Irish does it take to change a light bulb? Twenty One. One to hold the bulb and twenty to drink until the room spins.   (25) A Poem: A beer was spilt on the barroom floor,  And the bar was closed for the night... And out of his hole, crawled a little brown mouse,  Who made a funny sight... He lapped up that beer, on the barroom floor,  And back on his haunches he sat... And all through the night you could hear him yell,  \"Bring on the damn cat!\"    (26)After spending a happy evening drinking together, two acquaintances promise to meet again in ten years at the same bar, same time.   Ten years later, the first guy walks in, looks around, and sure enough, there is his friend on a bar stool. He clasps the old friend's hand and cries, \"The day we left, I didn't think I'd really see you here!\"   The friend looks up, stares, sways slightly and asks, \"Who left?\"   (27)A man comes in to the room and says to his wife, \"I'm going to the pub. Get your coat on.\"   The wife, overjoyed that he has included her in his activity replies, \"Does that mean that you are taking me with you, darling?\"   The husband replies, \"No - I'm turning the heating off.\"   (28)Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel ashamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered.   Then I say to myself, \"It is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver.\"   (29)Two young Irish men were getting ready to go on a camping trip. The first one said, \"I'm taking along a gallon of whiskey just in case of rattlesnake bites. What are you taking?\"   The other one said, \"Two rattlesnakes!\"  (30)A rather drunk man was walking along the street one day. He was staggering quite a bit and made two nuns that were approaching him, very nervous. The two nuns split apart and one walked to the man's left and one walked to the man's right.   After the nuns were past the man, he turned around and said, \"Now how in the hell did she do that?\"   (31)This small skinny dude walks up to the bar and starts to sit on a bar stool, and a big dude on the next stool says, \"That seat's taken!\"   The little dude sits down anyway. The big dude grabs him and whacks him several times with the back of his hand and tells the bartender, \"When he wakes up, tell him that was Judo from Japan.\"   Next day the little dude returns, before the big dude gets a chance to hit him, he hits the big dude several times and the big dude falls to the floor. The little dude tells the bartender, \"Tell that sucker when he wakes up, that was a Monkey Wrench from Sears.\"   (32)The car sped off the highway, went through the guardrail, rolled down a cliff, bounced off a tree and finally shuddered to a stop. A passing motorist, who had witnessed the entire accident, helped the miraculously unharmed driver out of the wreck.   \"Good lord, mister,\" he gasped, \"Are you drunk?\"   \"Of course,\" said the man, brushing the dirt from his suit. \"What the hell do you think I am ... a stunt driver?\"   (33)A man walks into a bar and orders a beer and the bartender asks him to pay up. The guy says he has no money, but for the beer, he will sing through his asshole. The bartender is a little bit skeptical, but figures if the guy can do it, it's worth a beer. He agrees and the guy gets up on a stool, drop his pants, bends over, and then shits all over the bar. The bartender is pissed and screams, \"What the hell did you do that for?\"   The guy replies, \"Sorry, I was just clearing my throat.\"   (34)Another rotten poem: Starkle, starkle, little twink, Who the hell are you I think. I'm not under what you call, The alcofluence of incohol. I'm just a little slort of sheep, I'm not drunk like thinkle peep. I don't know who is me yet, But the drunker I stand here the longer I get. So just give me one more fink to drill my cup, 'Cause I got all day sober to Sunday up.   (35)A boy is watching television and hears the name Jesus Christ. Wondering who Jesus Christ is, he asks his mother. She tells him that she is busy, and to ask his father. His father is also busy so he asks his brother. His brother kicks him out of the room because he doesn't have time to answer his stupid questions, so he goes downtown and sees a bum in an alley.   He asks the bum, \"Who's Jesus Christ?\"   The bum replies, \"Well, I am.\"   The boy, not believing the bum, asks for proof. So the bum takes the boy into the bar down the street and takes him inside. They walk up to the bar and the bartender exclaims, \"Jesus Christ, are you in here again?\"   (36)A completely inebriated man was stumbling down the street with one foot on the curb and one foot in the gutter. A cop pulled up and said, \"I've got to take you in, pal. You're obviously drunk.\"   Our wasted friend asked, \"Ociffer, are ya absolutely sure I'm drunk?\"   \"Yeah, buddy, I'm sure,\" said the copper. \"Let's go.\"   Breathing a sigh of relief, the wino said, \"Thank goodness, I thought I was a cripple.\"   (37)Two buddies were sharing drinks while discussing their wives. \"Does your wife ever...well, you know...does she...well, let you do it doggie style?\" asked one of the two.   \"Well, not exactly,\" his friend replied, \"She's more into the trick dog aspect of it.\"   \"Oh, I see. Kinky stuff, huh?\"   \"Well, not exactly. Whenever I make a move, she's most likely to roll over and play dead.\"   (38)A guy goes up to a girl in bar and asks, \"You want to play \"Magic\"?\"   She says, \"What's that?\"   The guy answers, \"We go to my house and screw, and then you disappear.\"   (39)  There is man sitting in a bar who is really, really drunk. When the bar closes he gets up to go home. He stumbles and falls couple of times and finally manages to get out of the door. As he gathers himself, he sees a nun passing by. He stumbles over to her and starts punching her in the face. The nun is shocked beyond belief, but before she could say anything, he leans over and punches her again.   This time the nun hits the pavement. The drunk stumbles over to her, kicks her in the butt, picks her up and throws her against the wall. By now the nun is very weak and can barely move. He leans over her, grabbing her by the collar of her habit and says, \"Not feeling too STRONG tonight, ARE YOU, BATMAN!\"    (40)This guy goes into a bar and sees a man pounding shots of bourbon as fast as the bartender can pour them. He watches for a while then finally goes up to the drunk.   \"What kind of a way is that to drink good bourbon?\" he asks.   \"It's the only way I can drink it since my accident,\" the man replies, throwing down two more shots in fast order.   \"What kind of accident was that?\"   The man guzzles another shot, shudders and then answers, \"I once knocked over a drink with my elbow.\"   (41)An Irish guy walks into a bar. The bartender looks him up and down and says, \"Hey, you got a steering wheel on your pecker.\"   The man replies, \"Ay, it's driving me nuts!\"   (42)  A guy traveling through the prairies of the USA stopped at a small town and went to a bar. He stood at the end of the bar, ordered a drink, and lit up a cigar. As he sipped his drink, he stood there quietly blowing smoke rings.   After he blew nine or ten smoke rings into the air, an angry American Indian stomped up to him and said, \"One more remark like that and I'll smash your face in!\"  (43)A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, much like the brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. The slowest buffalo are the sick and weak so they die off first, making it possible for the herd to move at a faster pace.   Like the buffalo, the weak, slow brain cells are the ones that are killed off by excessive beer drinking and socializing, making the brain operate faster.   The moral of the story: Drink more beer, it will make you smarter.   (44)Bill sat at The Local Bar, bragging about his athletic prowess. None of the regulars challenged him, but a visitor piped up, \"I'll bet you 50 bucks that I can push something in a wheelbarrow for one block and you can't wheel it back.\"   Bill looked over the skinny stranger and decided it wasn't much of a challenge. \"I'll\" take you on,\" he said.   The two men and a number of regulars borrowed a wheelbarrow and took it to the corner. \"Now let's see what you're made of,\" taunted Bill.   \"Okay,\" said the challenger. \"Get in.\"   (45)This guy enters a bar and orders two shots of vodka. He drinks the first and dumps the second on his right hand. He then orders a second round of shots, drinks the first and again dumps the second on his right hand.   The bartender sees this and becomes curious as the guy orders a third round and does the exact same thing.   So the bartender asks the guy, \"Hey man I hope you don't mind me asking but why the waste of good drinks?\"   The man say's, \"I have to get my date drunk!\"   (46)While nursing a drink at a bar, a young woman was distressed to see a drunken, unkempt man sit down next to her. He says, \"Say, honey. . . I'd really like to get into those pants o' yours.\"   \"Thanks,\" she shot back, \"but I've already got an asshole in there.\"   (47)Sitting at the bar, glum Roger told the barkeeper that he was drinking to forget the heartbreak of his broken engagement. \"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"would you marry someone who didn't know the meaning of the word faithful, and who was flip and even vicious when the subject of fidelity came up?\"   \"No way in hell,\" the bartender said.   \"Well,\" said Roger, \"neither would my fiancée.\"   (48)A guy runs into a bar and says to the bartender, \"Give me twenty shots of your best scotch, quick!\" The bartender pours out the shots, and the guy drinks them as fast as he can.   The bartender says, \"Wow. I never saw anybody drink that fast.\"   The guy replies, \"Well, you'd drink that fast too if you had what I have.\"   The bartender says \"Oh my God! What is it? What do you have?\" The guy says, \"Fifty cents.\"   (49) McNamara walked into a bar and ordered martini after martini, each time removing the olives and placing them in a jar. When the jar was filled with olives and all the drinks consumed, the Irishman started to leave.   \"Excuse me,\" said a customer, who was puzzled over what McQuillan had done. \"What was that all about?\"   \"Nothing,\" said the Irishman, \"My wife just sent me out for a jar of olives.\"   (50)Having had one too many, a bar drinker was beginning to display an ugly side. An unescorted female sat down beside him and he whispered to her, \"Hey! How about it babe? You and me?\"   As she got up to move, he said loudly, \"Honey, you sure look like you could use the money, but I don't have an extra two dollars.\"   She looked back and replied just as loudly, \"What makes you think I charge by the inch?\""}

As he steps outside he notices a stray dog sitting on the corner of his deck and calls for it to come over. He asks for it's paw and it hands it right over and offers a shake. \"What a good boy\" the man thought to himself. He had lived in the town his whole adult life and knew all of his neighbors in town, but he'd never seen the dog before. He decided he would ask around and if no one claimed him in a week he would keep the dog and adopt it. Sure enough a week goes by and no one has claimed the dog, so the man decides to adopt the dog and he begins letting it sleep in his bed instead of in his guest room. Now, the old man had heart issues and had a pace maker put in to maintain his heartbeat should something happen. He has a heart attack and stops breathing and the dog takes notice and jumps out of bed and runs down to the kitchen. The old man's heart starts back up and he wakes up from the small jolt from the device. He hears a voice coming from downstairs and notices his dog has gone missing, so he creeps down to the edge of the kitchen and listens in. He hears \"The target is deceased, I need to arrange for transport\". Thinking something terrible has happened to his new dog he jumps around the corner and flips the light on, only to see his dog on the phone. \"Holy shit! You can talk!\" The old man yells. \"Holy shit! You're alive!\" The dog yells back."}

Through collective effort, pizza places find ways to stay open, despite all the bad publicity being thrown on them. Eventually, the inevitable happens; a longtime player in the pizza market has to close up shop. This triggers an immediate reaction from everyone left open, and they call an emergency meeting. Despite all their brainstorming, not one person in attendance can think of a way out. Panic ensues. They start to realize their fate. The Clean-Eaters have won, and with one down, they will all fall like Domino's."}

Whoever can throw his brick the highest wins!\"  \"That sounds like fun; I'm in!\" Replied the second man, Tom.  \"But how will we measure who's goes the highest?\" inquired Jim, the third man.  \"Simple,\" exclaimed Joe, \"the higher your brick goes, the deeper it will embed itself into the mud when it lands. That's how we'll decide the victor.\"  \"Sounds fair to me!\" said Tom, grabbing a brick and stepping out into the clearing. \"I'll go first.\" He took the brick in two hands, bent his knees, and threw the brick with everything he had. It went up, and it went down, landing with a satisfying *thud* and *squish*.  \"Four inches,\" he announced, \"I can do better than that!\" He squared his posture, took the brick in both hands, and with even more power than Tom had, he launched the brick to the skies. It went up, up, and it went down.  \"Tom measured the depth of the hole, and, defeated, said, \"six and a half inches.\"  \"My turn,\" said Jim cheerily. He stepped out into the clearing, grabbed the brick with his right hand, and with unnatural speed and power, shot the brick toward the clouds above like a trebuchet. It went up, up, up, up, up, until neither Joe nor Tom could see it anymore, and it never came down.  ...  Okay, I can tell that one fell flat a bit, so enjoy this joke as a sort of consolation:  A woman wanted to fly to Paris with her pet parrot to attend her mother's funeral, but it was such short notice that the only flight she could afford was on a no smoking, no parrot airline. As anyone would, she hid the parrot in her coat and boarded the plane. After the plane was in the air, the pilot handed over control to the copilot and began walking down the aisle with a massive cigar in his mouth and making small talk with the passengers. He arrived at the woman's row and asked her how the flight was going, his voice slightly hard to understand because of the sheer size of the cigar.  \"It's wonderful,\" she said, \"because the weather outside is so nice, I could look out the window forever.\"  \"I'm glad,\" said the pilot, and just as he was turning to move on, he heard something: *SQUAACK!*  He whipped back around and glared accusingly at the woman. \"Miss, you don't happen to have a bird on this plane, do you?\"  \"Of course no-\" *SQUAAACK!*  Furious, the pilot lept forward and ripped open her coat, grabbed the parrot, and began waving it around wildly like some conductor of the weirdest orchestras in the world. \"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A PARROT ON THIS PLANE!\" he bellowed before opening the window, tossing the bird out, and promptly closing it again.  The woman, equally enraged, grabbed the cigar out of the pilot's mouth, and waved it around in a similar fashion, yelling \"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A CIGAR ON THIS PLANE!\", and she opened the window, threw out the cigar, and closed it again.  The pilot stormed back off to the cockpit, no longer in the mood to talk to passengers.  Around an hour had passed when the pilot heard a knocking on the cockpit's side window. He ignored it, figuring it was a figment of his imagination, but then again, a knocking. He glanced over, then did a double take. Flying alongside the plane was none other than the parrot he had thrown out the window. And what was in his mouth? The brick.  _________  To give credit where credit is due, I did not come up with this joke. I don't remember where I heard it, but it's my favorite."}

Eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.  They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. At the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.  The little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. When the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age.  The little girl proudly replied: “I worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”  “Oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”  The little girl replied, “I will if those assholes from Lowe’s ever deliver the damn drywall.”"}

Every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\"; Again, the teacher asked for the moral of the story. Lucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\" Next up was little Johnny. \"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\" The teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.   \"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't fuck with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking."}

She agrees and a very close match ensues. She turns out also to be a very talented golfer and she wins their little competition on the last hole.   He congratulates her in the parking lot, then offers to give her a lift when he sees she doesn’t have a car. All in all it’s been a highly enjoyable morning.   On the way to her place, she thanks him for the morning’s company and competition and says she hasn’t enjoyed herself so much on the course for a long time. “In fact,” she says, “I’d like you to pull over so I can show you how much I appreciated everything.” He pulls over, they kiss and she shows him her appreciation.   The next morning he spies her at the first tee and suggests they play together again. He’s actually quite competitive and slightly peeved that she beat him the previous day. Again they have a magnificent day, enjoying each other’s company and playing a tight, competitive round of golf. Again she pips him at the last, again he drives her home and again she shows her appreciation.   This goes on all week, with her beating Fred narrowly every day. This is a sore point for his male ego but, nevertheless, in the car home from their Friday afternoon round, he tells her that he has had such a fine week that he has a surprise planned: dinner for two at a fancy candle-lit restaurant followed by a night of passion in the penthouse apartment of a posh hotel.   Surprisingly, she bursts into tears and says she can’t agree to this. He can’t work out what the fuss is about but eventually she admits the reason.  “You see,” she tearfully sobs, “I’m a transvestite.” Fred is aghast. He swerves violently off the road, pulls the car to a screeching halt and curses madly, overcome with emotion. “I’m sorry,” she repeats.  “You bastard,” he screams, red in the face, “You cheating bastard. You’ve been playing off the red tees all week!!”"}

On the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him:    \"I'm sick of all these conferences. I always say the same things over and over!\"   The driver agrees: \"You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place.\"    \"That's a great idea!\" says Einstein. \"Let's switch places then!\"    So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.    But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.    The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :    \"Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me."}

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, \"My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?\"The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"The man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"The monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"The monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.

The other patrons thought he was blowing smoke and decided to make a bet... if he won they would buy him a drink, if he lost he owed the whole bar a round. They blindfolded him and took him to his first animal skin. After feeling it for a few moments, he announced \"Bear.\" Then he felt the bullet hole and declared, \"Shot with a .308 rifle.\" He was right. They brought him another skin, one that someone had in their car trunk. He took a bit longer this time and then said, \"Elk, Shot with a 7mm mag rifle. He was right again. Through the night, he proved his skills again and again, every time against a round of drinks. Finally he staggered home, drunk out of his mind,and went to sleep.  The next morning he woke up with a headache and a black eye. He said to his wife, \"I know I was drunk last night, but not drunk enough to get in a fight. Where did I get this black eye?\"  His wife angrily replied, \"I gave it to you. You got into bed and put your hand down my panties.

First, you have to drink that whole bottle of pepper tequila- the WHOLE thing at once- and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a pit bull chained up out back with a sore tooth. You have to remove the tooth with your bare hands. Third, there is a 90-year-old woman upstairs who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta make things right for her.\"  \"Well, I know I've paid my $10 bucks,\" says the man, \"but I'm not an idiot. No wonder you've collected so much money -- that's impossible!\"  The new guy proceeds to drink several whiskeys, and eventually, he gets up his nerve.  Slurring, he yells \"ALLLLLRIGHT! Where'sat tequilla?\"  He grabs the bottle of pepper tequila with both hands and downs it, gulp by gulp. Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but he doesn't make a face. Next, he staggers out back. Everyone in the bar hears a huge scuffle outside -- barking, yelping and growling, then silence.  Just when they think the man must be dead, he staggers back into the bar with his shirt ripped and gashes across his body.  \"NOW,\" he says, \"Where'sat woman with the sore tooth?\""}

He is away from home for sometimes 4-5 days at a time.  He is married.  No kids.  This wife of his, well, she is super fuckin' hot.  Like, she is at least a 9/10 and she knows it too.  You should see the way she flaunts herself around sometimes.  It is crazy.    &#x200B;  Anyway, after a while this dude starts to think \"a babe like that, and with me being away so often... I wonder if she is cheating on me?\"  Now, this was back in the early 80s, and security cameras were not nearly as affordable as they are today.  He wanted one that he could hide while he is away, but he just couldn't afford one.  &#x200B;  One night he and I were chillin' at the bar and having a few drinks.  He tells me about his potential problem, but that he doesn't know how to know what goes on at his house when he isn't around.  Then it hit me.  \"Dude, you need to get a parrot and teach it to talk.  That way the bird can tell you what it saw when you get back from your business trips!\" Damn, that was a good idea.  Sometimes I come up with the most genius shit.  &#x200B;  So the next day this guy is at the pet store.  He tells the shop owner that he would like a parrot.  The shop owner got a bit of a frown.  \"The only one I have... well, I don't think you want it\" he stated.  \"Why not?\" asked my buddy.  The shop owner takes him over to a bird cage and removes the cover. Get this... this bird had no legs!  My friend asked \"well how does it stay on it's perch?\"  The shop owner tells him that the only way for the bird to do that is if you wrap it's dick around the perch.  The bird was used to this, and balanced on there pretty good with just it's big dong. \"What?!\" you must be asking. \"You cant be serious\".  I am totally serious about this.  &#x200B;  Now my man has this parrot at his house.  It took a while, but he taught the thing how to talk.  Once the training was done, this bird had a pretty good handle on the English language.  A few days later, my buddy is again away on a business trip.  When he cam back, he asked the bird if any men came to the house.  &#x200B;  \"First day, mailman came.  He gave lady the mail.\" the bird said before giving out a squawk.  &#x200B;  \"Ok Bernard (that is what he named the bird.  pretty stupid name for a bird if you ask me), then what happened the next day.  &#x200B;  \"Mailman came and gave lady the mail.  The two of them chatted for a few minutes and then she rubbed her hand across his chest.  That is all.\"  &#x200B;  \"Ok Bernard, then how about the next day?\"  &#x200B;  \"Mailman came.  Lady and mailman took off each others clothes.  They were licking each others tongues.  Lady laid down on the couch mailman put his head between her legs.\"  &#x200B;  My buddy started to get pissed.  \"Bernard, then what happened?!\"  &#x200B;  \"Mailman lay down on couch.  Lady got on top of him and bounced around.  Her boobs were shaking up and down\" Bernard said, before going silent.  &#x200B;  My dude asks the bird \"and then what?\".  &#x200B;  The bird didn't say anything.  &#x200B;  \"Bernard, tell me.\"  &#x200B;  Bernard looked at him right in the eye, paused for a moment, and then shouted \"I FELL OFF MY FUCKING PERCH!\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "One sultry Sunday afternoon in Rome On one sultry Sunday afternoon in Rome, there was a beautiful young nun walking back home after the service in the church. The priest who was driving back home in his wagon spots the poor nun walking home in the sweltering heat. Being the gentleman that he was and a servant of the Lord, he stops by the nun and offers to drop her home in his wagon. The nun coyly refuses the first time to not bother the priest too much. However, on further insistence she obliges and hops on.   The heat was quite unbearable. The nun slightly unbuttons her habit slightly exposing her well-endowed busom to cool off a bit. Naturally, this activity caught the priest's attention too and he was shuffling nervously in his driver's seat. He overcomes his inner inhibitions and places his hand on the knee of the young nun. The nun looks at the priest reassuringly and says 'Father, remember Luke 14:10'. The priest, embarrassed by this, gets back to his driving. Few minutes later, the nun is wiping the sweat off her temple and once again the attention of the priest is titillated. This time he slides his hand slight upwards on the nun's thigh. And true to word, the coy nun reminds the priest again of the Biblical verse. 'Father, remember Luke 14:10'. 'The flesh is weak, dear', sighs the priest apologetically. He recalls his duty as an agent of the Lord and pulls away once and for all. He drives on and with chivalry drops the nun at her doorstep.  Back at his home, he struggles to remember the words of the verse referred to by the young nun. So, he heads to his study and looks in his Bible - \"But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, 'Friend, move up higher'\""}

On July 17, 1946 , the temperature in Detroit was 97 degrees.     The four brothers walked into old man Henry Ford's office and sweet-talked his secretary into telling him that four gentlemen were there with the most exciting innovation in the auto industry since the electric starter.    Henry was curious and invited them into his office.      They refused and instead asked that he come out to the parking lot to their car.      They persuaded him to get into the car, which was about 130 degrees, turned on the air conditioner, and cooled the car off immediately.      The old man got very excited and invited them back to the office, where he offered them $3 million for the patent.      The brothers refused, saying they would settle for $2 million, but they wanted the recognition by having a label, 'The Goldberg Air-Conditioner,' on the dashboard of each car in which it was installed.      Now old man Ford was more than just a little anti-Jewish, and there was no way he was going to put the Goldberg's name on two million Fords.      They haggled back and forth for about two hours and finally agreed on $4 million and that just their first names would be shown.    And so to this day, all Ford air conditioners show --      Lo, Norm, Hi, and Max -- on the controls."}

Hook consults with Smee and his crew.  &#x200B;  Finally, the day arrives and Pan eloquently delivers his point of view, countering each of Hook's points brilliantly and in a way that would make Michael Darling quite proud. However, at the end of it all, Hook merely snarls, sticks out his tongue and smirks knowingly at the Chief.  &#x200B;  Surprisingly, the Chief sides with Hook and allows him into the village, to the dismay of Pan and Tiger Lily. After Hook leaves smugly, Pan walks up to the Chief. \"Chief,\" he says, \" I thought I had done really well today, using words to fight instead of my knife and hands. Everyone in the crowd appears to have been on my side. Tell me... what did Hook say that convinced you?\"  &#x200B;  The Chief looked at Pan and, after a moment's thought, replied \"Well, on one hand, you did have a very good argument and countered his points skillfully. On the other hand, Hook had a point.\"  &#x200B;"}

Is there anything else you'd like to tell me?\"   The grandfather simply says, \"There's also one loaded gun in the glove box, one in each door jam, and one under each seat.\"   The officer asks the men to step out of the car, and handcuffs the pair.

Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now 100,000 pounds to the fire station who could bring out the company's secret files. But still the fire fighters could not get through.   From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby rural township volunteer fire brigade, composed mainly of old men over 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant. Without even slowing down it drove straight into the middle of the inferno.  Outside, the other firemen watched as the old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before. Within a short time, the old timers had extinguished the fire and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to 200,000 pounds and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.  The local TV station caught the thank you on film and asked the chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"   \"Well,\" said Paddy, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"the first thing we're gonna do is fix the brakes on that bloody fire truck.\""}

{"instruction": "Tell a dark joke.", "input": "", "output": "trying to rope a deer Written by someone who wants to remain anonymous.   I copies the text, if not allowed, please remove. But I thought it was pretty funny so I wanted to share.   It's loooong but SO worth the read!  Actual letter from someone who farms and writes well!     I had this idea that I was going to rope a deer, put it in   a stall, feed it up on corn for a couple of weeks, then kill it and eat it.     The first step in this adventure was getting a deer. I figured   that, since they congregate at my cattle feeder and do not seem to have much fear   of me when we are there (a bold one will sometimes come right up and sniff at the   bags of feed while I am in the back of the truck not 4 feet away), it should not   be difficult to rope one, get up to it and toss a bag over its head (to calm it   down) then hog tie it and transport it home.     I filled the cattle feeder then hid down at the end with   my rope.     The cattle, having seen the roping thing before, stayed well   back. They were not having any of it.     After about 20 minutes, my deer showed up -- 3 of them. I   picked out.. ..a likely looking one, stepped out from the end of the feeder, and   threw.. My rope. The deer just stood there and stared at me.     I wrapped the rope around my waist and twisted the end so   I would have a good hold. The deer still just stood and stared at me, but you could   tell it was mildly concerned about the whole rope situation.     I took a step towards it...it took a step away. I put a little   tension on the rope and then received an education.     The first thing that I learned is that, while a deer may   just stand there looking at you funny while you rope it, they are spurred to action   when you start pulling on that rope.     That deer EXPLODED.     The second thing I learned is that pound for pound, a deer   is a LOT stronger than a cow or a colt. A cow or a colt in that weight range I could   fight down with a rope and with some dignity.     A deer-- no chance.     That thing ran and bucked and twisted and pulled. There was   no controlling it and certainly no getting close to it. As it jerked me off my feet   and started dragging me across the ground, it occurred to me that having a deer   on a rope was not nearly as good an idea as I had originally imagined.     The only upside is that they do not have as much stamina   as many other animals.     A brief 10 minutes later, it was tired and not nearly as   quick to jerk me off my feet and drag me when I managed to get up. It took me   a few minutes to realize this, since I was mostly blinded by the blood flowing out   of the big gash in my head. At that point, I had lost my taste for corn-fed   venison. I just wanted to get that devil creature off the end of that rope.     I figured if I just let it go with the rope hanging around   its neck, it would likely die slow and painfully somewhere. At the time, there was   no love at all between me and that deer. At that moment, I hated the thing,   and I would venture a guess that the feeling was mutual.     Despite the gash in my head and the several large knots where   I had cleverly arrested the deer's momentum by bracing my head against various large   rocks as it dragged me across the ground, I could still think clearly enough to   recognize that there was a small chance that I shared some tiny amount of responsibility   for the situation we were in, so I didn't want the deer to have to suffer a slow   death, so I managed to get it lined back up in between my truck and the feeder -   a little trap I had set before hand...kind of like a squeeze chute.     I got it to back in there and I started moving up so I could   get my rope back.     Did you know that deer bite? They do! I never in a million   years would have thought that a deer would bite somebody, so I was very surprised   when I reached up there to grab that rope and the deer grabbed hold of my wrist.     Now, when a deer bites you, it is not like being bit by a   horse where they just bite you and then let go. A deer bites you and shakes   its head --almost like a pit bull. They bite HARD and it hurts.     The proper thing to do when a deer bites you is probably   to freeze and draw back slowly. I tried screaming and shaking instead. My method   was ineffective. It seems like the deer was biting and shaking for several minutes,   but it was likely only several seconds.     I, being smarter than a deer (though you may be questioning   that claim by now), tricked it.     While I kept it busy tearing the tendons out of my right   arm, I reached up with my left hand and pulled that rope loose. That was when   I got my final lesson in deer behavior for the day.     Deer will strike at you with their front feet. They rear   right up on their back feet and strike right about head and shoulder level, and   their hooves are surprisingly sharp. I learned a long time ago that, when an animal   \\\\-- like a horse --strikes at you with their hooves and you can't get away easily,   the best thing to do is try to make a loud noise and make an aggressive move towards   the animal.   This will usually cause them to back down a bit so you   can escape.     This was not a horse. This was a deer, so obviously, such   trickery would not work. In the course of a millisecond, I devised a different   strategy. I screamed like a woman and tried to turn and run.     The reason I had always been told NOT to try to turn and   run from a horse that paws at you is that there is a good chance that it will   hit you in the back of the head. Deer may not be so different from horses after   all, besides being twice as strong and 3 times as evil, because the second   I turned to run, it hit me right in the back of the head and knocked me down.     Now, when a deer paws at you and knocks you down, it does   not immediately leave. I suspect it does not recognize that the danger   has passed. What they do instead is paw your back and jump up and down on you   while you are laying there crying like a little girl and covering your head.     I finally managed to crawl under the truck and the deer went   away.     So now I know why when people go deer hunting they bring   a rifle with a scope to sort of even the odds."}

The wife does her best to work solo, but no matter what, she is never really satisfied.         To correct this issue, the wife decides to see a specialist without her husband, as he does not seem to find the problem with their situation.  The doctor listens to the woman and proclaims, “Ha! I have just the thing...” as he walks to the back cabinet and grabs a pill bottle from the top shelf.   “These are extremely potent tablets.   You want to mix some of these with your husbands dinner.  Start slow, with maybe half a tablet.  I must stress that these are VERY potent.”   Well the wife is overjoyed with this prognosis and hurried home, anticipating the arrival of her husband for the evening.        When the husband gets home that evening, the wife does as the doctor suggested and breaks one of the pills in half and crushes it before mixing it in to her husbands mashed potatoes.  That evening, after their kids go to bed, the couple have their first sex in over a year.  The wife is ecstatic, but disappointed that it only lasts 5 minutes.       The next day, the wife decides to up the dose to 2 tablets, and that evening, the couple have wonderful sex, and the wife is satisfied.       This continues for a few weeks, with the wife keeping the consistent 2 pill dose, until one day when the wife had an extremely stressful day at work.  She gets home very frustrated and just wants something to distract her.   She decides to make her husband a smoothie when he gets home, but slips several extra pills in it.               After two days, the police receive missing persons reports, as no one has seen the couple, and their friends and family are getting worried.   The inspector heads to the home of the family, and rings the door bell.   Through the window of the door, he can see a middle school aged kid waddling in pain up to the door.

They don't have very much money, but they have a scrawny little dairy cow that gets them through the hard times.   One day the farmer goes out to milk the cow, but when he gets to the barn, he finds the cow facedown and dead. He knows right then that it's all over, and he grabs the shotgun off the wall and shoots himself in the head.   His wife hears the gunshot and runs out to see what's happened. She finds the cow and her husband dead and she gives up on life. She grabs the shotgun and shoots herself in the head as well.   The eldest son comes home from work and finds his parents dead. He goes to use the shotgun, but it's out of ammo. Instead, he runs to the ocean to drown himself. But before he can do that, a mermaid comes out of the water.   \"Wait!\" The mermaid shouts. \"I know what happened to you and your family, and it's terrible! But I can make it all better! I have magic, but it's based on sex! If you can make love to me fifteen times in a row without stopping, I can bring back your mother, your father, and the cow. But if you fail, it will kill you.\"  He isn't sure he can do it, but he decides to try. He makes it five times before he gives out and he just can't do it. He can't go on anymore, and he dies.   The next oldest brother gets home and finds the corpses. He too tries to use the shotgun, finds its out of ammo, and runs to the ocean. The mermaid pops up and makes him the same deal-- but this time, it's 20 times, to save his brother too. He does his best, but he only makes it three times before he can't go on anymore. He, too dies from the magic.  The third brother gets home, and he finds his parents and the cow in the barn and his brothers by the ocean. The mermaid pops up and says, \"wait, wait, wait! I know it's a long shot, but I can grant you your wish if you can just make love to me 25 times in a row without stopping!\"  The third brother says, \"I dunno if that's a good idea. I mean, look at what I did to the cow!\""}

However, Joke did not believe this, and he firmly believed the soul was stored in comets, since they were sent from the heavens down to Earth.   Most would laugh at him, saying, \"You are ridiculous to believe that someone's soul would be stored in comets after they pass! You surely can't be serious!\"  But Joke kept his belief, and his family stood firmly behind him on it as well, believing it just as much as he did.   When he died, there was a service, and they buried him at night. At the end of his burial, everyone looked up to the stars.  They all whispered quietly, \"A new star is born for Joke, who has passed on from us into the heavens.\"  Everyone said this except for his family.   They whispered in unison to one another, \"The real Joke is always in the comets.\""}
